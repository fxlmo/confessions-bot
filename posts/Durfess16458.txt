I’m 21 and have never slept with anyone. I feel like the longer it goes on, the more likely people will be deterred by this. I’m just scared to put myself out there. Any tips for a size 12/14 gal with confidence issues in the Durham student population where most girls are ridiculously skinny and seem to have their pick from flocks of guys???
