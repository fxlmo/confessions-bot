My best friend got into a relationship and their personality has completely changed. We no longer gravitate towards the same topics of conversations, no longer do the same things, and we don't even have the same sense of humour anymore. It's been a struggle to even casually chat with them, because one of us is always compromising whatâ€¦ More we want to talk about in order to humour the other person, and we don't have the same chemistry that we used to. Is my friendship falling apart? I've known them for years and I just don't know what to do to save the friendship.
