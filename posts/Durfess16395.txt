I'm really angry and I'm really sad - not really sure what at - and that's what I hate the most. Uni life is always so busy and everyone seems to be having a great time, or is stressed about their degree and life for good reason. I don't have a good reason though, sure I'm stressed and worried about work but so is everyone else - I'm not special for that. So I'm fed up that little things are getting to me and I don't know why!
