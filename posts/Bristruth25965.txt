I know it's the end of term now and we are all going away, but please can we try and get the uni gym music to change for when we come back!! Why are there ballads being played whilst we workout not getting me pumped at all? I mean is Adele 'someone like you' really supposed to be blasted on speakers in a gym hmmmm ... please can we make a petition for there to be an actual gym playlist PLEASEEE!!!!
