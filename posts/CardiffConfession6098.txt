CPS homes are so out of touch with students that they turn to covering the streets in graffiti as a "quirky and hip" form of advertising - it's really not, it's just vandalism and they aren't fooling anyone. I feel like we should have an event where we go around cleaning it off the streets, bring some paint remover, a scrubbing brush and some tinnys and we'll make a day out of it
