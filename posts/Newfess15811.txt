I used to work at this holiday park over summer and as part of my job I had to dress as the holiday kids mascot which was this weird bird thing. Anyway my boyfriend came to stay and For some reason I just had no attraction to him anymore and I made him wear the head of the bird mascot whilst I gave him head (no idea why he agreed toâ€¦ More do it). Anyway then he found it really kinky and got really turned on by it. Now he always puts this bird head on to have sex and made a comment about me buying a bird costume to wear also. can someone please tell me if this is normal or do I need to break up with him
