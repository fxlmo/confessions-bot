Cute boy on the train platform at New St today waiting for the 17:33 train, talk with a brown coat and doing movember. You made that painful wait for the delayed train slightly better. If only Iâ€™d bothered to look nice today :( from the girl in the black coat who kept looking at the board behind you.
