I went to Leeds Medical Practice today and was told I had the flu. The tears began to brim over my eyes and the nurse, taking pity on my orphan student status, offered me a hug and said ill recover in no time and that my essays will get an extension. This made me stop crying. I looked at her in the eye and said `Janet, I don't care about failing my module, I care about missing fruity tonight'.
