Can we be real about these picket lines? I fully support the strikes, the gender pay gap is archaic for a start. But outside 301? Really? A building full of mentors for students with (often severe) mental health issues? Go ahead, strike, chant, block entry or whatever, but don't then post those statuses when mental health weekâ€¦ More comes around and you're suddenly a 'huge advocate' and 'there for my bbz whenever they need me'. You can support more than one group at once, not force mentors to cancel appointments or personally escort students across the line.
