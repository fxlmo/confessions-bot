I think that I’m a controlling bf. I’ve realised what I do when my girlfriend if out is questionable, like asking who she’s with, who’s in pictures ect. It’s my first relationship I’m sad that it’s a behaviour that I went to straight for my insecurities but I want my girlfriend to go out and enjoy herself without me being over the top. Hopefully it’s something that I can work on, show her how much I care and love her constantly and not let my insecurities hurt someone I love
