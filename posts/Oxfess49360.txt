it's my humble opinion that people shouldn't stick with relationships they're not 100% into. instead find someone you find attractive/funny/actually interesting and get to know them. you may be surprised. you may be disappointed. but at least you won't be wasting your time with someone who you know you'll end it at some point, when you get round to it...
