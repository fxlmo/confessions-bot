#TrUWE Funny how the people who like to tell us they are from private/grammar school's are the ones stealing my stuff and not returning for weeks in the kitchen, leaving the bins piled up and using my kitchen stuff. Guess money can't buy class. And as for Grammar schools... that's hardly anything to be proud of. And omg we are all at... UWE!!!
