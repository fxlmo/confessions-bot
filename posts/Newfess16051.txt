I've really fucked up my time here. I made a mistake sleeping with my mate's ex and i've lost my closest friends for it. It's my fault and I know that. I was just hoping that with time i'd move on and feel better, but it's been about 2 years now and every time I see or think about them my heart drops into my stomach and I feel like shit. I know things can't go back to how they were, but I don't understand how to move forward more so than I already have.
