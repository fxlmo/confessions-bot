4th year aero engineer here, went home this weekend, had my sister ask for help with her GCSE maths homework. I freaked the fuck out seeing the “divide” symbol because I didn’t know what it meant. My entire family thinks I’ve been lying about my degree this whole time. How do I explain to them that everyone’s used fractions instead of the divide symbol since A-Levels?
