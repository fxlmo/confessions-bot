Not to spark debate since the results are now what they are but comparing the total number of registered voters against the total number of votes in many constituencies is disgusting. I understand that a good number of these may have been caused by spoiled ballots but I'm incredibly shooketh if I'm to believe that tens of thousands of votes went unaccounted for due to that alone. Your vote matters (and mattered) as it may have either changed or strengthened today's Conservative majority result, whatever your political stance.
