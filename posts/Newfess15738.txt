Signed up for my religious society (Catholic) this year but have been too anxious and nervous to go to any of the events. Maybe partly because all my friends shit on/take the piss out of religion/religious followers and it makes me feel weird that I want to go to these events. And because I didn't go to the first few big events (onlyâ€¦ More the initial gathering) I felt like I would be too out of place and wouldnt fit in as everyone wouldve already settled. So i haven't gone to any events all semester. Do i try again next semester, or just wait for a new fresh year?
