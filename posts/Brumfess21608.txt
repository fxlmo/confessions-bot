Me and my boyfriend are long distance. We call about 4 times a week for 20-30 mins. We see each other every 3 weeks or so. The problem is more often than not while we are talking he is also playing a Steam game or scrolling through Facebook or reading BBC sport and I can tell he’s not listening. I can hear his keyboard tapping away… More too lol. I’ve asked if he is too busy and I wouldn’t mind calling a bit less if it meant it was a quality call but he wants to call this much!!! I’ve brought it up but he doesn’t stop. What can I do???
