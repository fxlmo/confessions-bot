To all the first year students take note of everyone on overheard trying to get people to fill their rooms, the friendships you have now might change and you could end up living in a house with people that drive you mad! Letting agents will try and tell you that all the good houses will go however this is not the case thereâ€¦ More are more houses to students and sometimes if you wait you might even get cheaper rent. Finally if you haven't found anyone to move in with don't worry sometimes moving in with people you dont know can be the best thing and give you an opportunity to meet people you otherwise wouldn't have a chance to.
