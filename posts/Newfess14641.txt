I did racist and homophobic things as a young/mid teen out of a place of ignorance. Now having come to uni and met lots of diverse and inspiring people I feel (rightfully) awful about it. I’m fully in support of NUSUs attempts to wipe the scourges of discrimination off our campus. Just an example that people can change and being from a certain background isn’t an excuse.
