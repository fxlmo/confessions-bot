Is anyone interested in a sitcom society? So this would include shows from America like the office, friends, parks and rec, how I met your mother, Brooklyn 99. But also shows from Britain like Friday night dinner, peep show, the inbetweeners, gavin and Stacey, outnumbered and Miranda. Suggestions for other shows welcome. If possible,… More the society would take the form of hiring a space to watch shows together, pub quizzes, etc. React to this post if you like the sound of this and if there’s enough interest I’ll get the ball rolling on it! :)
