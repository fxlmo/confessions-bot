It’s currently mid November, I’ve hated my flatmates since early October. They get pissy at me for coming home at 3am on a student night but it’s okay for them to stumble home at 3am this Wednesday and play kiss chase in the corridor at 11pm on a Thursday night. Is it immoral for me to do this? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hUyh_dqb7TA
