So, the lad I’ve been seeing lately decided to pop over on his way home from Bierkeller last night. He gets in the door and into bed, it’s all going well, when suddenly he feels very very sick. He proceeds to vomit violently into my bedroom sink, with the wall and the carpet being treated to a generous dose of vomit. There’s so much… More vomit that it nearly fills the sink to the overflow.
