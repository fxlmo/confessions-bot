I'm really starting to stress about housing for next year because all of my friends are graduating but I don't want to live alone or go back into halls?? I'd happily live with a few of the friends I've made through societies but it's so awkward to ask them to live with me?? Like I barely know you but how bout you come live with me next year? And I don't want to find a 4 or 5 bed house and then say to the landlord oh yeah sorry its just me lol
