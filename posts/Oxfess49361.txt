So, you looked cute and a little bit flustered putting in your ticket at the barrier at Paddington. You got stuck and looked a bit confused. I said that I think that only takes cards not tickets. We briefly met each others eyes on the platform next to the Oxford train. You hung around for a while but then left, so I thought you weren't going to Oxford... then I saw you at Oxford station getting a cab! Clearly fate.
