Can I say every one is shitting on CPS, but my experience with 2Let2 was a lot worse. Ant infestation, broken ovens and fridges, shelves missing, no proper heating (not just in our house, one viewing we went to one of the rooms didnt have a radiator and the tenant had to buy their own heater bc 2Let2 "doesnt provide extraâ€¦ More heating"!!), rats, the house was filthy when we moved in to the point there was a shit in one of the toilets and our deposit was not put in a DPS scheme after asking many times, which is ILLEGAL. They also gave us 0 warning for some visits, not even a text or email, they would just let themselves into the house and our locked bedrooms. It is not just CPS cutting corners with the law, so dont be blinded by all the bad CPS posts and think theyre the only bad agency out there
