Ok so I got a bit of stick for going home four times this term to watch the football but it's literally the only thing that properly excites me anymore. Is it bad that I just don't feel interested in anything else? Like I'm too preoccupied with the shit going on in my head to think about anything other than my course so going home for the football is often my only positive stimulus
