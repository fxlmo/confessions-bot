Right, backstory to begin with. I was a Pot washer at my local for 3 yrs before coming to uni and then freshers have the audacity to tell me how to wash my dishes! I literally was a professional washer upper at my local pub for 3 yrs washing grimey leftovers. Don't tell me how to wash my dishes when it was my literal job. PSA forâ€¦ More freshers who had mummmy and daddy do all their dishes for them, wash stuff straight after using it then leave it to drip dry. Don't leave crusty pasta leftovers on the side for 2 weeks before deciding you need that bowl. In short, git gud at washin dishes scrub or I'll your face with this wire scourer
