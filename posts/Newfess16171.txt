Me and my boyfriend keep telling eachother we love eachother when we are drunk. If I am drunk and he is not I will say it, if he’s drunk and I’m not he will say it if we are drunk together there’s a lot of loving. We have inside jokes about it when sober, We haven’t been together long but I really care for him. What does this mean? Do I need to try put an end to it?
