With regards to recent posts about labia, I'm assuming you've only ever been able to compare to porn. Women in porn don't even look like they have vaginas trust me labia is completely normal and I have no idea what is up with porn but that isn't the goal. I'm pretty sure most vaginas don't look 100% inside out like they do. My fanny is inside where it's supposed to be and there's nothing wrong with a couple of flaps covering your bits. If we didn't have eyelids we'd have constant eye infections.
