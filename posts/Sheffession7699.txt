After a mad few months of going out 3 times every week I go back home for the xmas holidays. This is when my mum decided to book my annual blood test. When I finally got the results back the doctors said to me “Your liver seems a little bit worn out, have you been drinking alcohol or taking any antibiotics?”, in my defense since my fanatic anti-alcoholic mum was around I responded “no, I hardly ever drink, must be the antibiotics”. And that moment I knew if there was one job I couldn’t do was being an actress..
