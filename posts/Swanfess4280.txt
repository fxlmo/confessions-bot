So last week, as a joke, I hid my housemate's toothbrush waiting for them to question its whereabouts because, ya know, you're meant to use it twice a day so they were bound to notice. It's been a whole week and not a word has been said. I even checked the hiding place and the toothbrush has not moved. I'm not gonna lie I'm slightly horrified. Apparently I live with people who just don't brush their teeth ever ðŸ¤®
