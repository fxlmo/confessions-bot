to the boy who was sat across the table from me in the IC last week, found me on Facebook, went to my youtube channel in my fb bio to check he'd got the right person, used my youtube name to find my insta handle, requested to follow me on instagram and then sent me a DM to tell me "I think you smiled at me in the IC last week, ty X it made my day" hope you're doing ok and get lots more smiles this week xxx
