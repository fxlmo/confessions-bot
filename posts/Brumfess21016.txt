Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with acne? I’m in second year and my acne has started to become increasingly bad over the past couple of months. I had pretty much clear skin in first year and haven’t changed anything except from becoming a vegetarian? Also I take multivitamins every day? Please help, this is constantly on my mind and giving me really bad anxiety
