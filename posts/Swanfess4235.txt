Right So I’m walking down a street yeah and I hear a car, mint car btw, playing some solid beat like the dirtiest beat yeah, so I obviously I turn to see and I go up to they car and ask ‘oi lads can I jump in’ they were like ‘hell yeah jump in’ one of the best ways I’ve made friends this year, we actually like friends now. Just felt like I had to share that.
