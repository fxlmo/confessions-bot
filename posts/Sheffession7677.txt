Arrived back home after 2 months in Sheffield, greeted by my lovely cat. Now, it's a bit of a joke in my family that I am the cat's favourite person, and this was evidenced quickly, as she was by my side for the last two days constantly. However, she also pissed on my jacket as (I assume) she felt it smelled too different and had to be marked. So swings and roundabouts.
