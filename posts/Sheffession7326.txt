i overheard someone asking their mate to count the hours and divide by 9 grand, which is something I have been trying not to think of, especially cos it's twice for international students. But i did it, turns out for one hour of uni I don't go, the money i threw down the drain could've got me 20 falafel kings. also i have nothing against the coming strikes just saying.
