Can I just ask how people afford medication while at uni? I have a job, don’t spend that much on extras etc but I’ve not been able to afford my medication now for 2 weeks. It’s obviously been awful for my health and I just wondered how anyone actually does it? 9 quid a month or every few months adds up quickly but it’s needed.
