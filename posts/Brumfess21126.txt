I've been thinking a lot about my Jewish heritage and background, especially in the current climate of rife antisemitism. I don't practice the religion and never have -- and I consider myself an atheist -- but I would love to join a modern synagogue, to connect with Jewish tradition and custom without emphasis on creationist faith. Can anyone recommend any such organisations in the area?
