Last year, my vegan friend from back home came to Sheffield for one night. As a good friend, I whacked some vegan chicken nuggets in the oven for dinner and she gave me 3 hours of "why isn't everyone vegan" and "vegan meat actually tastes like real meat nowadays"... little did she know that I had accidentally bought the wrong packet and she was actually engulfing a whole plate of normal chicken nuggets... but gluten-free. To this day she still asks me what brand were those "delicious nuggets".
