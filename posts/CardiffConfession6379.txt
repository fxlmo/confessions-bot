God it’s depressing being home for Christmas. My family are so dysfunctional and miserable but won’t accept any support. Nothing ever changes and it’s just so draining. I’ve made excuses to go back to Cardiff early because being at home makes me so sad. I can’t bear to tell my family why I’m really leaving, because it’ll make… More them feel worse. I feel so guilty for not wanting to spend time with them because I know they won’t be around forever, but I just can’t do it. All I see on Facebook are my friends having a lovely time with their families and I just feel so alone.
