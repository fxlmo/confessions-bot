Just your friendly reminder to be patient and respectful to retail and bar workers at this time of year, no we don’t want to be working these shifts but someone has to. Things like stock levels and prices are something that the people working the tills can’t control so please don’t take out your anger and frustration on us,… More it won’t make us any more helpful. If anything it will make us less likely to help or serve you. So next time you’re out and thinking of being a dick to someone doing their job, don’t. It makes our job so much harder and it’s not needed. Especially when it’s so busy at this time of year. Love a disgruntled bar tender who’s sick of people being dicks
