Right then. My course ball was on Tuesday. With a lab at 9.30 on Wednesday, I thought I would take this one easy. Unfortunately, I don't remember leaving the place of the ball (owned by Corp). Ended up spending £100 that night, transferring money from various bank accounts. £50 was withdrawn from various ATMs across Sheffield, some… More of which even charged for transactions. I woke up with none of this cash. None of my coursemates saw me, apart from being thrown out of SOYO. Many apologies to half the people in my contacts I decided to ring at 4.30am, but I'm glad to tell you all after a 4.30 convo that my girlfriend from Year 8 has settled in well to university (hadn't spoken to her for 4 years). Incase you were wondering, I did make my 9.30 lab, and ended up crying to my ex for 30 mins afterwards. Happy Christmas Sheffield, miss you already x
