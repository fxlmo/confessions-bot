Right so after being at Hughâ€™s for a term and attending some of the JCR meetings I have to say there are multiple roles on the committee that I just donâ€™t agree with/understand why theyâ€™re there. Itâ€™s become increasingly obvious that the elections are a popularity contest. Especially the role of freshers rep, I canâ€™t really see whatâ€¦ More has been done except organising the timetable and taking care of all the bureaucratic stuff like sub fusc etc. All the promises of getting to know us when we come but then we never see her around College and when we do she is just with friends so you canâ€™t speak with her anyway? My number one pet peeve is people pretending to be all friendly and nice on social media but then itâ€™s a different story in real life. Slightly embarrassing how bait it is that they were elected just based off popularity rather than suitability for the roleðŸ™„
