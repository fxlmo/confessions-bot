I've recently noticed a lack of awareness on the effectiveness of the mumps vaccination and how easily it can be contracted. It is not 100% effective - more around 90-95% (according to the NHS website) - and so everyone is always vulnerable. Therefore it is wrong to assume someone has not had the MMR vaccine if they have caughtâ€¦ More mumps.
