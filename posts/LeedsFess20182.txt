Right for once and for all this is the official North South divide (Including the Midlands). No Birmingham is not in the North and no Scotland doesnt count towards the line (for all youâ€¦ More Newcastle is the only real place in the North dickheads). (If you dont believe in the Midlands fair game it is bs, just erase the South/Midlands divide and count it as THE SOUTH). For anyone from Wales or Scotland youll have to figure out your own North/South divide.
