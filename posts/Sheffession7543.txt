Can’t believe I really imagined myself at uni going for runs, getting up early and being productive. I’ve already fallen into the trap of alcoholism, 2 hours of sleep because i need to get to that 9am because encore sucks balls, just consuming an entire bag of donuts and chundering in the IC toilets. Have I peaked at life yet?
