I worked in Bar One for a year and you would not BELIEVE the things I've seen, especially on Roar and Pop Tarts nights. You know you can get those 4-pint jugs of beer? Well one time I was clearing up after this group of lads and they had left (I kid you not) a full 4-pint jug of piss in the corner. You know who you are and you're disgusting. Just go to the toilets you cretins.
