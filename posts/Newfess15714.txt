Ladies, please take note of your mood when on contraceptive pills. I was on microgynon for almost a year and at the end of it, i was crying 2-3 times a week and experiencing severe depressive episodes. Ive been off it for over 2 months now and I feel like Iâ€™m finally starting to feel like myself again.
