I've been suffering with PTSD for the last two years. My ex was abusive and didn't know how to take no for an answer. He did a heinous act which has left me a bit broken. I'm scared of him. I can't even go to his hometown because I'm scared I'd see his face. My nightmares stopped around 8 months ago, and my flashbacks areâ€¦ More less frequent. I'm seeing a therapist now, but it hurts to reopen my past, but I know it's for the best. Does anyone have an advice? Should I keep going? Should I do something else to distract me? I need suggestions.
