I’m a third year male and I have a problem. I’ve been with a few girls over the years (no relationships) and I don’t think I’ve ever properly had sex. I can never maintain an erection, it’s always almost there and it’s killing me. Does this happen to anyone else cos it’s at the point where I can’t tell anyone cos I’m not supposed to be a virgin, and now I don’t want to be with another girl cos i always have to make awkward excuses like I’m too drunk. P.S I can get one on my own
