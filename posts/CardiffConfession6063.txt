Someone I love had to have an abortion due to a previous problematic pregnancy. She wouldn't have been able to raise her two young children if there had been serious complications. She was a single mum at the time. She still thinks about it everyday. She is the bravest woman I know and I am proud of my best friend's strength. To the other women who have had abortions, you're strong and you had the right to your own choices. You do not deserve to feel bad for those choices, please know this.
