I've just found these in a uni bathroom and I would love to thank whover left them. They haven't been credited to anyone but I think it's a lovely thing to do. Each pack contains 6â€¦ More reusable pads of varying thickness, a flannel, soap and a cloth bag. This will come in very handy, save me money and is better for the environment. #endperiodpoverty
