I put on a very confident version of myself to people which has somewhat waned the last year or 2, lot's of people invite me to events and consider me a really good friend. But the truth is I have never felt anything when I think of any of these people and the thought of socialising leaves me bedbound for weeks at a time. I've attempted suicide twice in the past due to loneliness and I have no idea how to work through all the conflicting things going on inside me
