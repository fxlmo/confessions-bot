I think some people would consider me a conventionally attractive person and maybe the type of person would looks “Macho” but inside all I feel is fear and anxiety about everything in life. When I’ve tried to talk about this with people I trust they always assume it’s a joke and so I just play along and pretend it was. I started… More counselling at the uni and even then I felt like they didn’t believe anything I was saying and didn’t take me seriously. I feel hopeless and alone with no idea what to do
