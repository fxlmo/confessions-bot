So I met this boy at a work training day, a few weeks later he found me on Instagram and we’ve been messaging for like 3 weeks. We were joking about and he said he’d show me round Newcastle but he’s never asked me to do anything but why would he keep messaging me? Is he just too shy? Should I ask him to go out?
