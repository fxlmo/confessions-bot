Just want to highlight the importance of wearing earplugs at music events. A couple weeks ago my friend and I got very bad tinnitus and muffled hearing after a night out- we were pretty scared to say the least and we genuinely thought we’d fucked our hearing for good! Thankfully, the tinnitus calmed down after a few days and so did the muffledness. However there are some incidences where the damage is so bad it never clears itself up. So I honestly cannot stress this enough: don’t live in fear, protect your EARS!!!
