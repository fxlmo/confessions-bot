Thought that first year of uni would be nothing but sniffing lines and shagging 9’s but i’ve been bitterly disappointed to discover that it’s 50% just lecturers telling you ‘you’ll cover this in more detail next year’, 40% eating sleep for dinner and 10% wondering why the maple bank laundrette is so shit. Regardless we go again next semester lads
