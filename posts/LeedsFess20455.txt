My living situation has deteriorated pretty rapidly and this hasn't been helped by the anxiety I get when I have to see my housemates, they're two faced and petty to the extreme and if I could afford it I would move out. Every time I try bringing up some of the issues we have they're either uncomfortably nice about it (to the pointâ€¦ More where I start to feel I'm in the wrong) or brush the issue off and then nothing changes. I know this will ignite the usual "well posting about it on leedsfess won't help" comments but I could really do with the opinions of strangers on what I could do to improve the situation.
