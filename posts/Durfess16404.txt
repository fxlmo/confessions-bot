smh, the guy giving the sermon at the Christian union carol service 🎄🎄🗣📖 (which was full of bangers btw) had clearly never read St. Anselm's Cur Deus Homo ✝️. Christ's 👼 death 💀as ransom 🤑 for humanity??? Can you get more pre-scholastic??? V disappointed with this shit 💩 tier theology. But otherwise top notch evening 👌👌
