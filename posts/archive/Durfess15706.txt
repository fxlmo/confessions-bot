So.... I do geography, but what is geography. Is it something you do, or is it inherently emobodied in the discourse of materiality. Configurations surround the peculiarity of critically engaged narratives of the discipline. Such speculation regarding me colouring my map has been fragmented by a decoliniasation of the curriculum. Or is that just me?
