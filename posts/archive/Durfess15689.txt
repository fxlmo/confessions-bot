How do the estate agents think it is ok to make people CAMP OVERNIGHT outside their offices just so students can get the houses they want. It is appalling that students are literally made to wait in freezing temperatures just so they can get a house for next year. It's ridiculous and the housing rush should not mean students need to endanger their health.
