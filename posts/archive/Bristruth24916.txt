University of Warwick student here - I just wanted to say having been to both Bristol and Warwick uni, Bristol is decisively the better uni. As well as being higher ranked and having the better reputation, the type of people within the community of Bristol is so much better than Warwick. We're not even based in Warwick, why are we called Warwick University. Might as well be University of Coventry and be just as irrelevant.
