Palatinalps - as something that appears to be well organised and even reputed in the league of DUCFS, alas you have GREATLY FAILED. Tonight’s booking was something that can only be described as an UTTER SHITSHOW that ultimately led to very inequitable outcomes. Those that were in the queue from 5pm missing out in events after waiting for literally 6 hours. I hope you and wasteland (more like waste of fucking time land) up your games tremendously before January or we’re all in for a disaster.
