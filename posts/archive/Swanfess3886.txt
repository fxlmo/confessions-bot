I just want to give a massive thank you to the guys who checked I was okay while I was having a massive breakdown after My Nu Leng, you know who you are, and I just hope you know how grateful I am that people like you exist, and that you made me promise I wouldn't do anything silly, and that you offered to walk me back. I just hope that everyone in uni can be more like you guys
