As a shy girl I was never one to make friends easily, especially not guy friends. And now suddenly I have all these guy friends sprouting out of nowhere to the point where I now have more guy friends than girls- and none of them are potential boyf material. And I'm worried because they might just be friends with me thinking I'm one of them, a boy, lad, g, whatever. I don't want to be that! How do I change this?
