Its so rare to find someone you can consider a real genuine friend. I've been in uni 4 years and I hang around with the same people and go out with them/ speak to them in lectures etc but would we speak after uni? not a chance. There's just too many fake people around and if you're lucky enough to have people around you you can always speak to no matter what, hold onto them.
