Anyone else have both the canvas app and the clue period tracker app on their phone? Because they LITERALLY have the same logo. I swear everytime I need to check canvas for my essay deadlines I end up discovering that my period is due in 3 days. EVERYTIME. Please say I'm not the only hormonal idiot who gets them mixed up.
