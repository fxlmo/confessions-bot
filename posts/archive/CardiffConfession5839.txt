People getting angry that Gair Rhydd allowed a climate change denier to write an article demonstrates exactly what is wrong with universities. The climate has been fluctuating throughout the earth's lifetime and there is absolutely space for a scientific debate on the topic. "oh but it's just a fact" is such a weak,â€¦ More patronising and arrogant argument that just attempts to shut down debates that universities need to be at the centre of. I firmly believe that humans have played a massive role in causing the climate change crisis and far more needs to be done to protect the planet, but simply shutting those disbelievers down and implying that they're stupid does absolutely nothing to help the cause.
