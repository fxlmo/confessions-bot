what type of ticket do I need to ask for on a 6 bus? I’m always so confused and seem to be getting charged differently each time. I heard people speak of a £1 bus ticket for the day but there doesn’t seem to be any indication of this online and the bus drivers don’t seem to know what I’m on about :/
