Something not mentioned in the history section of UoS RAG's website is they used to have a comedy magazine that ran from the 50s to the 70s. Famous artists did cover art for it including Andy Warhol and, I believe, Prince. Why does it no longer exist? Well, the content in it was so scandalous and politically incorrect that sheffield city council labled it "a front to academia" and banned all sale of it in the city.
