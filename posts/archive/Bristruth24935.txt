So I know we all love a good bit of Tory bashing for their heinous crimes against the proles, but I'm not convinced that this translates into cheerleading for JC the Magic Grandpa. He's a socialist ideologue straight from the 70s, which means at the end of the day he cares more about nationalisation and workers rights than savingâ€¦ More would-be yuppies from their student fees, the climate from the crisis and the nation from Brexit. The magic money tree of TAXING THE ONE PERCENT will only go so far and I don't think you can be sure he'll spend it on the issues that students are affected by/care about the most (none of us were even alive to experience the wonders of British Rail in the first place). So does this mean we should all be voting LD or Green? Maybe yes, maybe no, but at least consider what you're actually supporting before throwing your full weight behind this version of the Labour Party, Debbie.
