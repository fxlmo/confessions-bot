I'm on the bus to campus, and I'm wearing a metal band t-shirt. I have earphones in, but I still notice a woman get on and look at my fashion choices disprovingly. She must assume that I'm listening to some horrible noise, but I am actually listening to Juice by Lizzo. Life is good. I feel fabulous.
