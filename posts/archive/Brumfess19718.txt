I had fusion surgery on my spine for scoliosis when I was 17. Feel a lot less self-conscious that I used to about it, although I’m still worried people will make fun of me. I don’t go to the gym or lift weights, instead I do bodyweight HIIT and jogging. I don’t do sports that involve twisting too much like golf or tennis but I feel… More pretty active. I didn’t do strenuous exercise for a few years after the surgery but now I’m fine with it. Push ups, aerobics are good. Swimming I’ve also heard isn’t too strenuous on the back - if you’re worried about what people will think of your torso I suggest going to a nudist beach. I went to one in spain, was more worried about my top half than the bottom, you just need to get used to not caring, then you’re cool.
