It's all well and good for the uni to tell students not to walk home alone but maybe they should have a word with the wanker bus drivers who pass people at bus stops (especially girls like myself) on their own at midnight, smiling and waving as they, and their empty buses, drive along, without a care in the world. I should be able toâ€¦ More rely on this so called UniBus service 24/7, but apparently they're as useless in the night as they are when I'm trying to get to and from my lectures. The money I paid for my term bus pass would probably be better spent on a bloody taxi pass the amount I rely on them ðŸ˜‚ Swansea Uni/Students Union, sort it out please? ðŸ™„
