To the guy in sin on the tuesday, don’t know if you’re a fresher or just very dull. When you go on a night out it’s okay to pull, but if you fail to pull a lass in a group, don’t think that gives you the right to try and pull every other lass in the group. Also when a girl says no, it means no, please learn how to read body language and don’t be a fucking creep on night out.
