Honestly just miss my ex so much, I have tried talking to new people and it’s been 2/3 months but I’m just getting worse and worse. I get panic attacks over them all the time when they out as I know they could easily go find someone new, it’s ruining my life and making me not want to leave my house anymore. Any advice ?
