Explain this: why is it I do fuck all during the day when I assignments due? Complain about life? Then work to the early hours of the morning? Go bed late? Wake up and promise myself not to do it again? But to then instead repeat the process? HELP ME - an over tired uni student in need of a sustainable way to live atm
