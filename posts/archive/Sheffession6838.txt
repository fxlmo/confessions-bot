Everytime I see a posh rich girl in the IC with her white filas, flared pants and urban outfitters jacket, I can't help but picture our dream life together......... Its our wedding day (in the Cotswolds of course) you'll arrive in your mum's range rover evoque, I'll go with your old man in his defender. We'll move into an oldâ€¦ More country cottage with enough acres for you to keep 5 or 6 of your horses. It will be cosy, but large enough that when the cleaners come we can hide from them in other rooms of the house and read the daily mail. And Then we'll wait happily ever after for your parents inheritance to come through. At which point I'll divorce you, take my money, head back up north and tell all my friends of how I fought the Tories and I won........ PS I'm a history student this is my best career prospect.
