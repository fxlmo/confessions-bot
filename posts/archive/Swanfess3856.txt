Dont you love it when you get up nice and super early, to see the doctors as they have a ridiculously bad system, and then proceed to sit and wait for 2 hours, missing all your lectures for the day and still not seen the doctor... wtf is wrong with swansea' medical system, worse than a 3rd world country, could fly to africa and get better health care
