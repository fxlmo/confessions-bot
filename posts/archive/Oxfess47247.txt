Yes I get that doing two essays a week might be difficult. But let's be honest, doing a humanities subject is, to a certain extent, a massive indulgence. For example, I'm here, doing Classics, with very few lectures worth going to, no language work, writing about the particular merits of one ancient Roman's love poetry over another andâ€¦ More musing on the progressive style of ancient Athenian sculptors, submitting essays to tutors who I drink wine with multiple times a year, and who are very relaxed about missed deadlines even if I have no excuse other than I went out too hard at the weekend. Let's not pretend we have it anywhere as difficult as scientists with huge amounts of compulsory lectures, labs, and problem sheets, and are actually studying things that are actually real and productive and matter to people's lives.
