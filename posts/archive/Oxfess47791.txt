Met a guy at a party, made out, nothing else happened. Texted him and we agreed to meet more than a week later. I’m scared because he’s much more experienced than I am, and I think he just wants one thing out of this and I don’t want to just sleep with him, yet I’m inexplicably drawn to him and don’t want to be rejected - how do I proceed with this? Should I be open about what I want or let things be?
