This might sound selfish but I don’t feel like I’m clicking with the people in my flat but rather pretending to some extent. They are nice enough people but not really my cup of tea. I want to branch out and meet girls or even guys that want to watch movies, go for coffee, museum dates and go on maybe sports activities or just have decent conversations. I don’t want my days spent on waiting to go clubbing like my flat, I want actual memories.
