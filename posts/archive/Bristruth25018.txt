A reminder that reclaim the night isn’t some f*cking party or some excuse to get drunk and disruptive (which happened whilst marching last year). It’s a protest and a very sensitive subject so can we actually try and have some respect for the many many victims both globally and in Bris who have experienced gender based violence. Respect is easy.
