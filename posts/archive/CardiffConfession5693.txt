I feel like I need to ask for someone elseâ€™s opinion and guess this is the best way? Me and my ex broke up nearly a year ago but ended on good terms (mainly due to long distance) yet still pretty much communicate someway or another each day? And I feel this is why I still think about him way more than I should :(((((( is this normal??? What should I do???
