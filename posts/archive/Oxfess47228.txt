I don’t understand why the grad students are so chippy. So far I’ve had just one conversation where they didn’t try to actively devalue Oxford and make a point of how it was a bad/over-sheltered/over-rated place to do an undergraduate degree. I would never suggest that Oxford is superior to other universities because I genuinely don’t think it’s the case + look who’s actually got a degree but fr if one more grad student tells me how much easier I have it than they did... it’s just rude, even if it’s true.
