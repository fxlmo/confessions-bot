Being the one person who checks up on friends makes me feel kinda special but knowing that I won't get the odd text or call about my day because I'm the 'checkup' guy honestly just really really fucking hurts, wouldn't say depressing because that's a strong word but my fuck me. Please just talk to me before I talk to you first, it'd do my mental health good.
