Rememberance Day is a forced tradition. I refuse to follow a holiday the Monarchy created as a way of pacifying our rage at the first world war with an insincere 'oops! so many people died!' memorial, as opposed to making changes to the system that caused the war and the negligent mass deaths in the first place.
