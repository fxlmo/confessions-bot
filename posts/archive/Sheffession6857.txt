Last year I had a girl over. In the morning I heard a faint knock on my bedroom door and as I groggily awoke, my landlord and a bunch of students barrelled in for a viewing. They all started laughing and I was really confused until I realised that I was naked out of the covers, she was hiding under them and had been watching my little pony, but neglected to turn it off. Even my landlord laughed as he apologised and backed out of the room.
