A guy used to like me but he wanted to go a lot faster than I did. I told him I think we should be friends. But now I can’t stop thinking about him and I haven’t talked to him since because we don’t have the same friends and I don’t have a reason to. Do I tell him I’m interested again or do I just never talk to him ever again?
