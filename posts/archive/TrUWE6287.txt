I spend all my free time and money on drugs because they are reliable and have caused me less heartache than any of the people I have mistaken for friends, nothing has caused me more paranoia in the last few months than discovering what my flatmates are capable of, which apparently is stuff far worse than using drugs to cope with my life, but of course you know that already.
