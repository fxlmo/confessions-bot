I would honestly go through years of content creating and everything to build a youtube following just to make one video debunking all these 'day in the life of an oxbridge student' vids. All they do is feed into unhealthy myths about oxford without ever actually addressing real sources of stress and mental health issues. Yeah sure these youtubers totally get up at 5 every day to revise and spend 11 hours in the lib with zero procrastination (when they don't have exams this year and also never miss a Bridge lol)
