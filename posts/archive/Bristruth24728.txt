Imagine this, its your 70th birthday, your entire family comes round to your house to celebrate. Your spouse leads in your two children and your adorable grandchildren (who have grown up so much after you last saw them). They ask you what life was like in 2019, you smile and begin to tell them about social media like facebook.
