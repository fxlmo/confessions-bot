Highlight of my year abroad in Spain so far has been me frantically trying to explain to a guy I got with that I wanted him to finger me, after I remembered that 'fingers' and 'toes' are the same word in Spanish. If that isn't a turn off then I don't know what is. Luckily the poor lad (Roberto) understood the message and didn't tryâ€¦ More to insirt his toe into me.
