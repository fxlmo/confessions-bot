Soooo... told my flatmate last year I liked them. They said they didn’t feel the same. Life went on and we were chill. Skip to after the summer. Back at uni. Been on a couple of nights out and they seem to be coming onto me but I’ve been trying to keep my distance because of what they said. Question... what do I do? Do I leave it or go for it again?...
