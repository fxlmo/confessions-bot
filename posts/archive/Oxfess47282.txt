It's been nine months but I still lie in bed wondering what I did wrong, and why things had to end. Most of all I wonder how I went from being able to talk with you for hours to being unable to carry a conversation. Hanging out with you these days makes me so emotionally fragile that the smallest things crush me. The worst thing isâ€¦ More that this is such a juvenile problem with such an obvious "solution", so I feel like an idiot if I try to confide any of this to anyone. I hope you think about me sometimes too, but I hope I can get over you.
