One of my best friends is great fun and we’re really close, but I’ve started to notice she can be really manipulative and make attempts to put me down and embarrass me regularly. My other friends have picked up on it too. I’ve tried to speak to her but it only ends in arguments. ❤️ For just try and speak to her again, everyone deserves a second chance 😡 for get rid, she clearly doesn’t care about your feelings
