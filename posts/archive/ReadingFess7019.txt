To the girl shouting “who the fuck do you think you are” down Addington Road at half three in the morning, who the fuck do you think you are? Don’t care how much you’ve had to drink, be considerate when walking through a neighbourhood at this time, especially during the week. It’s not hard to keep it down while still chatting with your mates on the way back from a night out.
