I don’t know what’s worse. The fact that I opened my camera roll to a picture of a fat spot on my chin and my friend thought it was picture of my nipple or that when we were discussing this an old man on west street, who was looking over our shoulders, chimes in saying I think it looks lovely. Kill me.
