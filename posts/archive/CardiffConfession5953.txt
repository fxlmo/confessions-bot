With everything going on with the Exeter page, I want us as a Cardiff Community to reach out to our Cardiff Confession and Cardiff Bae admins, and ask - are you all alright? Are you coping with managing the sites, or are you feeling overwhelmed? Is there anything we can do to help as a larger community, or a greater way weâ€¦ More can show our support?
