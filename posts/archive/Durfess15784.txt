My housemate keeps smoking cigs in the house because it’s raining so much. He says he doesn’t want to get wet and it’s ok because he does it by the back door with the door open. We think it stinks the house out and is just a bit gross. Happens maybe three times a day. Durham can you help us solve this house argument?
