was really looking forward to making pals similar to me at uni but it hasn’t happened :( want to meet people who are interested in doing cafes and getting food or chill drinks and day trips to new places and shit in the day and then nights out like going to a good burger place and having a few ciders, pub quizzes, movie/ games nights,… More bars with a live band etc. Also interested in clubs just the ones that play smth other than drum and bass and are only fun if you’re one of the people getting fucked up on ket (no shade if that’s what floats your boat tho). Anyone wanna be my pal pls
