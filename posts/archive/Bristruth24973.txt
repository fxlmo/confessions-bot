I’m sorry but the new Sainsbury's spaghetti is utter shit. I was naively enticed by the ‘Italian’ style packaging (and the fact that they’ve now taken all other options off the market apart from the organic range). I brought it home, excited to try out my new purchase, and low and behold it’s not even spaghetti shaped. To save money… More I suppose, each individual spaghetto is comprised of three even smaller strands that form a triangular shape instead of the rounded shape we all know and love. Furthermore, I placed the “spaghetti” into the pan, and it immediately looked like noodles. The more I stirred, the more I realised that to my dismay, this was not the same old spaghetti with different packaging oh no no no. This is a new type of beast altogether. This is not spaghetti at all. If anyone can learn from my mistakes, please DO NOT BUY THE NEW SPAGHETTI. We are a powerful force and if we fight together, we can take it down once and for all. Spaghetti is the backbone of student living and WE. DESERVE. BETTER.
