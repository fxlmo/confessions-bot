I need some help here. I have a habit of talking to everyone and in the process, I end up sharing my personal life stuff with them, or give them insight into how I think i.e. my anxieties, fears etc. As a result I end up unable to manage all the relationships, maybe share more with them then they would like or depend on them and peopleâ€¦ More end up hating me.
