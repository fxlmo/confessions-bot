Workers have the right to unionise and strike. Privileged students who have never been in that position do not have the right to complain. Yes, it's disruptive, but disruption is the point. It is a hugely difficult decision for any university staff to make, and strikes are only ever a last resort. In an ideal world, where workersâ€¦ More are treated fairly, no one should ever have to strike again, but as long as workers are exploited, they have the right to fight for better pay, pensions, and job security. Decide what side of the picket line you want to be on.
