My ex-girlfriend was controlling, manipulative and abusive. So it's not like i'm exactly looking to talk to her but there are specific situations where we have to interact for friendship group reasons and I just wish she'd stop outright blanking me and pretending I didn't exist in such an obvious and mean-spirited way. I feel like anâ€¦ More idiot for caring about it, but it makes me feel like i'm being forced out of my friendship group.
