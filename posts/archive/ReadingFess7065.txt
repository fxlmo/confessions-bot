Ok hear me out, most guys are like "wHy DoNT GiRLs meSSAgE GuYS FIRsT?!" But when a girl actually does message a guy first they think they're the shit and get too cocky and think they can now pull every girl in existence, not actually borhering with the girl that did message them. Guys want a chance, prove me wrong.
