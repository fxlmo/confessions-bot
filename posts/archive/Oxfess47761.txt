Ox HATE to the counselling service honestly. I'm sure the individual counsellors are trying their best but how am I supposed to open up about something traumatic when I know in half an hour you'll send me on my way mid-speech probably in tears and alone to handle it myself for the next two weeks. Anyone else with difficult pasts finding it more harm than good??? And what's the deal with the four session limit... Can't figure out if they're going to cut me off after my next session or not.
