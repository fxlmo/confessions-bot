Pretty sure all of my housemates with myself included try to avoid each other and listen to who is moving in the corridors so we don't bump into one another. It's honestly the best when the kitchen is empty as well. One time, my friend and I were cooking and one of my housemates walked in, walked around the table and walked out. Must have made a mistake in his people avoiding skills.
