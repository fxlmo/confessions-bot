I know we are a great uni and I love studying here but we need to stop comparing ourselves to UOB. Although guardian put us close in the league tables that ranking includes student opinion poll and doesnâ€™t reflect the true league tables. Employers will still look more for UOB than UWE for traditional subjects. So we need to own our differences and focus on how good we are in the creative subjects!! Let UOB have their colonial elitist heritage and focus on ourselves!
