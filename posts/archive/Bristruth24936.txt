Is there some sort of watchdog for SU societies? I am part of a sports society that I used to love but I keep learning about some terrible things within it. Impossible standards for people, dangerous situations and people given free passes just because they are key on the team and a lot of general nastiness that is hushed up andâ€¦ More excused. General favoritism instead of valuing peoples merits- for instance people who wouldn't condescend to attend the 'essential' tryouts still making teams. I don't want to snake my team but at some point peoples mental and physical wellbeing must come first right? Where can I go to report this because I dont think I can stand by and watch a lot of this anymore.....
