I'm really worried about my housemate. She recently had unprotected sex. At first she was worried and considered buying the morning after pill, but now she wants to get pregnant instead. She thinks that they would have a beautiful baby and so therefore wants it. She thinks a house baby would be fun. What should I do? How can I get her to change her mind? Thanks
