Fuck the mental illness awareness hype. I hate how hypocritical people are. They post about mental health awareness and all this bullshit but when it comes down to it they don't give a shit about anything but themselves. They just act as though they care so they seem like a good person. When it comes down to it they don't actually check-in with those who they know are really hurting.
