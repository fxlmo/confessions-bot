People with their cars at uni need far more credit from those who seem to think we’re taxis. Just because I’m not doing anything important doesn’t mean I want to drive you across the city for free, or even the £2 you’ll give me to cover my petrol. It’s not unreasonable of me to not want to waste my time chauffeuring you around so don’t act like it is you fucking brats. I’m not your dad.
