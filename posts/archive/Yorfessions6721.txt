Fairfax House accommdoation does not exist. All things you call 'proof' are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the leading committees of the university. Your Fairfax House friends? They're all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world. It was actually invented by UOY so it couldâ€¦ More enable the suffering of tens of thousands of students rather than send them to 'on-campus' accommodation that's actually on campus. Nearly every person at every level is in on the massive scheme, including unibus and taxi drivers who have actually only been bringing students to identically decorated student housing or "in some cases, parts of St John's."
