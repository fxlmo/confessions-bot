Bruh Cardiff administration is actually wank. How can you expect 110% from students at this pReStIgIoUs uni when you struggle with the bare minimum?! Keep asking for information already sent months ago or threatening mandem with "outstanding fees" as somehow no one clocked you're on an abroad placement??? Step the fuck up and stop bombarding people with threatening emails because none of you speak to each other ðŸ¥´
