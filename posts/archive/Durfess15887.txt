If you come to my door for a viewing and I tell you it's not a good time and you'll have to come back later that means it's not a good time and you're going to have to come back later if you want a viewing. It is not and never will be an invitation for you to tell me how in a rush you are and how busy you are later and try to argue your way into a viewing; all that does is make you look like a rude and annoying twat who thinks they're somehow entitled to come into my house on your timetable.
