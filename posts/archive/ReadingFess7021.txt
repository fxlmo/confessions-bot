Actually wish I took Computer Science instead of my subject. They’re literally like “Beep beep boop bop” and then they’re on £80k after graduation with no student debt at all, since any company is willing to pay all their student loan like it’s just pennies to them. Is it too late to transfer course? (Asking for a friend, obvs)
