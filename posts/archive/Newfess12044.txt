I have this really good mate from home who I've ended up being his rebound between his last 3 gfs (as in gf, me, gf, me, gf) over a few years years. I'm pretty chill about it but I know I have some level of feelings for him whenever I see him. Hes messaged me relatively out the blue telling me hes about his latest shag, even though Iâ€¦ More didnt know he'd broken up with his latest gf, so was already slightly annoyed he hadn't told me about that. Hes harping on about how he likes this new lady despite only knowing her for a day and how he can see a future with her etc. I want to tell him he needs to learn how to be alone but feel like I cant without me coming across like I want him. I also kinda want to tell him that I cant keep hearing about his gfs or shags bc it's just exhausting for me to pretend not to care. Idk what I wanted out of this post, I'm just shit at acknowledging feelings and I'm sick to death of him having me for a mug.
