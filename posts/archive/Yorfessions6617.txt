Just wondering if anyone has heard whether the University and YUSU are planning any events on campus either on Remembrance Sunday (this Sunday 10/11) or Armistice Day (this coming Monday 11/11) so that we can pay our respects to our injured and fallen servicemen and servicewomen from Britain and the Commonwealth who have given theâ€¦ More ultimate sacrifice for our freedom over the last 100+ years.
