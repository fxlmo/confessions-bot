It's been 18 months, and I'm still in love with a girl I broke up with because I thought I didn't love her anymore. Realising that I was wrong has ruined my life and my degree, and I can't get her to think about taking me back because she's seeing someone else. I've slept with and dated so many girls to try and get over her, but noneâ€¦ More even compare. Therapy and meds don't do anything either. She was the only girl I've ever seen a future with, but now I don't even see a future for myself. Guys (and girls, and non-binaries etc.), if you love someone then don't let them go, it could be the biggest mistake you'll make.
