Know it sounds shit but my flat mates are so pretty and they always pull and always win fittest etc etc in drinking games and it’s just making feel really shit about myself... I’m not even ugly tbf like I’m a pretty standard looking girl but at home I was always the most intelligent so I didn’t care that my friends were better looking, but here I feel stupid too. Just feel like pure shit and uni has absolutely destroyed my academic and general Confidence. But it’s fun
