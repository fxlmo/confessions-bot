Is it just me or do I see a lot of posts about people wishing they had said something or are too scared to tell the person they like that they wanna be with them (even if it’s their own flatmate). Grow some balls people because excuses like ‘distance’ for example are shit excuses to not want to be with someone. Doesn’t matter if… More they’re on the other side of the world for a period of time or if they’re only a few hours away. If you like someone, tell them. Otherwise you can’t say much when they end up with someone else, wishing it was you who will be waking up next to them. So stop posting ‘I wish I had said something’ when all you have to do is speak up. I’m rooting for you guys.
