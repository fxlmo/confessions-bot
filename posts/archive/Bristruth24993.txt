So I come from a Commonwealth country and to my surprise, we have the rights to vote in the UK. I feel conflicted though. After consulting peers, they all seem to be happy for me to exercise my rights to vote UNTIL I tell them I'm going to vote for the opposite party (which I'm not going to btw, just wanted to see what they actuallyâ€¦ More think). What if I'm in favour for something controversial like a hard Brexit? What if I decide to support whichever party is willing to push for a 2nd referendum? Does those 2 conflicting situations change your opinion on my rights to vote?
