I find it too jarring that the counselling services doesn’t have any BAME counsellors, I found it so difficult to explain and rationalise my issues with my family and the power structures within my community to the counsellor, and my reticence and shame associated with speaking out.. I sometimes felt that I was being belittled or told I was making a mountain out of a molehill when the counsellor just didn’t understand .. smh
