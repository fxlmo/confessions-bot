my girlfriend is gonna judge me hardcore for this but i’m posting it anyways: i’m a bisexual girl and i’m currently dating a girl who also happens to be my flatmate. butttt i’m not out to my parents. and i wanna tell them but i also don’t want to cuz i have 3 sisters and 2 of them have already come out as bi. so like i don’t wanna… More be another one cuz i think they won’t believe me. idk why but i think that’s what will happen cuz they didn’t think my little sister was actually bi and was just confused and my dad said he just wants a kid that will have a nice husband and kids which i assume he meant me but like idk it’s not their business but i also don’t want them to judge me. i also don’t want them to judge me for dating my flatmate (cuz they will lmao) so like helpppp what do i do? i wanna show off my girl but idk how comfortable i am with my whole family knowing (especially since it’s a pretty new relationship) so yeah help
