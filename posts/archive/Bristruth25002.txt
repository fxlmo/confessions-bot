To everyone who bashes Johnson and all of you who think Jeremy Corbs is a ‘decent’ person. He’s not even close, he allied with and supported the IRA in the 80s when it was blowing up civilians including children and he was not just ‘talking to terrorists to try to get them on side’. He’s allied with Putin’s Russia, theocratic Iran.… More Never using this as a platform to criticise the way Putin’s suppressed the democratic movement in russia or the way Iran persecutes gays, women and ethnic minorities - Just going along with them because they’re anti-Western.
