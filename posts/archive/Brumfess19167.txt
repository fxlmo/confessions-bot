I have only ever been treated badly by boys. They don’t care about my feelings towards them and I think they have their egos boosted when I fancy them but never want to actually make a move. They flirt with me and tell me all these nice things so I begin to really like them, but they never actually say anything about liking me even… More though all the signs are there. They then proceed to ignore me and not even care that I exist, only when it suits them. It’s made my self esteem so low and it’s made me feel like I’m so ugly. Now I don’t trust any boys. It’s been really upsetting and I don’t know how to meet boys that aren’t like this, it seems to be just my luck... Any suggestions?
