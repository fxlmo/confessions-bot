Was talking to a guy on tinder for a couple of days and he told me he had just got back from a driving lesson after we didn’t talk for a bit, he’s 22 and I said ‘still can’t drive at 22 ;)?? And he said the reason why he hadn’t learnt to drive is because his aunt had died in a car accident and he was too scared to learn. That’s the last time I use the treat em mean keep em keen approach. Thanks a lot Rachel, thanks a lot.
