As someone that works for the Tab, the slating of Gair Rhydd is actually laughable and if I didn't want to go into journalism I would of left them already. The piece they did is completely fine and a healthy debate, all the Tab cares about is views and being liked. The 'Election Scandal' last year? Completely unfair andâ€¦ More written to get views and comments. The Quidz / Paper vs Quids in at Pryzm debate? Fuelled by Paper essentially buying us off - did you know we had a joint social last week that Paper paid for so we wouldn't do any negative press against them / wrote articles they wanted. When the Tab 'lets you know what initiations sport teams are doing' - we know we're causing shit but its good coverage so hey ho why not..
