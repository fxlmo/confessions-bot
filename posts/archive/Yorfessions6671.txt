What's up with Fencing Society? Bit weird that only the committee gets positions in the Saxon Army to retake Hastings from the Normans? They preach 'inclusiveness' but there's not a single fresher being asked to pay their lives on the line for the safety on the kingdom?? I paid my membership fee but the Knights of the Round Table are such a clique it makes me sick.
