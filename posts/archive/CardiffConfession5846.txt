This whole hating on Gair Rhydd thing is ridiculous. Know the facts for God's sake! The piece about Climate Change was a COMMENT debate piece based on the OPINIONS of two different Cardiff University students. That is what is called good journalism. Not for a second is Gair Rhydd denying climate change, the views expressedâ€¦ More were blatantly not those of the University Newspaper as the click-bait headline piss poor journalism of The Tab would have you believe. If The Tab fancy having a go at proper journalism they could learn a thing or two from Gair Rhydd. Don't turn on the people who do a damn good job with the Uni Paper , maybe instead think about how you feel that there are so-called journalists from The Tab Cardiff creeping on Cardiff Confessions, looking for the next gutter trash scandal story they can milk for content. Including their editor.
