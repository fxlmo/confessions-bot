Please use your vote in the forthcoming election. You can register at both uni and home time address so can choose last minute. ASK yourself what you want from the next Government. Its not all about Brexit. We are all students and will graduate soon, so what sort of economy and society do you want to be a part of for your most importantâ€¦ More 10 years of your life? Think to yourself, (for example) if your main objective is to starve the Conservatives of a majority but you a vote in Bristol North West and a Lib Dem voter. Then voting for Darren Jones (Labour candidate) is probably your bet. Tactical voting. The same applies the other way aswell.
