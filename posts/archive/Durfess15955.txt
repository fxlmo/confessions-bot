I must be the first person to go to university and accidentally get healthier. I've gone from eating dreadful food, drinking, occasionally taking drugs, and doing no exercise to eating almost nothing but vegetables, barely going out, sleeping for 10 hours and staying awake during the day. I even go to the gym and play for two sports teams!
