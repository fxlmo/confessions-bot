Sometimes you can’t cycle on the road because it’s chockablock with traffic and there’s literally no option but to go on the pavement. Cars get more annoyed if you’re on the road causing even more traffic once it start moving. As long as you aren’t racing down the pavement and pedestrians can clearly see you coming so they have a chance to take one step to the side and aren’t bowled over by you, you’re okay.
