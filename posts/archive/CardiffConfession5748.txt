How about instead of moaning constantly that the SU is “too full” and that the SU committee needs to “change urgently!” By not letting in other universities You look elsewhere to have a social, or host it on a day that isn’t a Wednesday and go somewhere else. Instead of whinging that a BUSINESS isn’t changing it’s BUSINESS MODEL because it doesn’t suit your needs on a night out. (You’ll also then be able to have a night out that doesn’t require queuing for 2hours and leaving your house at 8pm!)
