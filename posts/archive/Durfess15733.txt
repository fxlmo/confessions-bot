Joined a DU team this year and as a result have had to forfeit my entire social life. I feel completely alone most nights when my housemates are all off at some social/night out, while I'm stuck at home sleeping before the next early morning start. I love the sport, I love the progress I've made but I don't know if its worth losing my friends and missing out on everything they do together.
