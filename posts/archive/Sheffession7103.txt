I was worried I wasn't fitting in at uni and that commuting in from another town rather than living in accommodation was a contributing factor. However, on Thursday I got stranded in Sheffield due to the floods and the student population really helped me out. This is a far too limited place to go into detail but I just want toâ€¦ More thank all those who responded to panicked social media posts by offering me places to stay and especially the guy outside thd IC who 1. Asked if I was ok (being stranded by a flood can cause panic attacks yo) and 2. offered to buy me food when I explained what happened
