My boyfriend is the sweetest guy I could ask for, he does everything for me, and really does treat me like a princess (cliché I know). But that’s only when we’re in private. Whenever we are around his friends (or mine but not to the same extend) he becomes so unaffectionate, cold, and “lad-like”. He’s like a completely different person. It doesn’t put me off him, but I wonder if this is normal? Are all guys like this, and why?!
