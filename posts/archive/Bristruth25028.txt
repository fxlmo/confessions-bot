@#Bristruth24957 They already are privatising it. They give out contracts to private companies and keep the NHS logo. The problem is funding, which the Conservatives have always done less than Labour on since Thatcher, and significantly less than thatcher in the past nine years. Actually do some research on how this government hasâ€¦ More crippled the NHS or maybe *speak to literally any nurse* before you go on some pedantic rant about how 'technically we aren't going privatised because the NHS hasn't been sold'.
