Why the fuck are fireworks still a thing? All they do is piss people off and harm the surrounding environment. Cardiff sort yourself out. Please can we NOT set off fireworks when people are trying to sleep, it’s fucking 10.30pm and unlike some of you I really need my sleep. From a fucked off student. P.S. can’t wait to wake you up with a massive bang when the police arrive at your front doorstep.
