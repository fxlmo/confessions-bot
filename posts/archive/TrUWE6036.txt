Does anyone else feel really anxious and unhappy when they're in uni? Outside of lectures and seminars I'm quite a happy, normal person but as soon as I'm on campus or around anyone on my course I become an anxious, nervous wreck and have to spend nearly a full evening in bed feeling awful so I can recover. Is anyone else going through this or do I need to pull myself together?
