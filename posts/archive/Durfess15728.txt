It’s a sad day now that McDonalds have fired their CEO and ex-Durham alumni for having a relationship with an employee. With him goes all my hopes of ever getting a McDonalds which is actually conveniently located in Durham town center (no Gilesgate doesn’t count - that might as well be Newcastle for all I care)
