I was visiting a swamp in East Anglia the other day and came across the strangest of places. It was almost as if a load of people were pretending to be at Oxford: they had it all, “colleges”, “punting”, “JCRs”, “Balls”, “Matriculation”, “libraries, a “union”. Real strange place. Reminded me of Las Vegas but without the casinos: it was so noticeably fake and half good that it was desperately sad. Two and a half out of five stars, I’d say.
