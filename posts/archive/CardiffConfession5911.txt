last night we acquired a pumpkin costume in walkabout. he somehow found his way to us on the dance floor and quickly became one of the crew. we named him cyril and when his previous owners could not be located we took him home. he is safe and well here, but if you’d like to retrieve him let us know, we think he’s a bit homesick.
