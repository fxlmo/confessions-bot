I'm in a big social web with my flatmates and coursemates yet I feel like even tho I have good friends I can fucking tell I don't entirely fit in with any groups and that fact has completely fucked me over for second year living because everyone's living with eachother and I'm out here being promised that 'we'd stay close' evenâ€¦ More though people switched from promising to live with me next year to secretly signing for a house with everyone else in a few hours. It's so jarring and upsetting to be thrown into thinking about next year so quick and I feel hopelessly lonely rn
