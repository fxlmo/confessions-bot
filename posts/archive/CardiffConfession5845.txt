The number of people on here that mindlessly conform to the narrative around Climate Change is baffling. You'd think that people studying at institutions that were created to encourage independent thought and debate would be somewhat sceptical of a narrative that's been pushed by governments, both left and right, and big corporations for the last few decades. Then again, maybe it's too dangerous to have a non-conformist opinion.
