I crashed today - I know its cliche because its 5th week blues and all that, but I just suddenly feel terrible. My mental health is crashing down on me, I know the essays I'm working on is dreadful, I don't want to annoy my friends by moaning to them, and the person I like definitely doesn't like me back. I just want to cry, everything feels terrible all of a sudden.
