For a few months now I have been contacted through fake accounts trying to create drama in my personal life. One account in particular has contacted my friends and is trying to spread rumours and create tension in my previous relationship. I have always asked for my privacy when it comes to my relationships and my friends are fully… More aware of that. However, this particular account is adamant they are in my close friendship group and cannot admit their identity because they don’t want to create drama? I have kept this quiet for a few months but I’m unsure what to do. If I block the account my friends get messages. When I go away or post anything on my story the accounts constantly messages me trying to break up my relationship. Uni’s difficult I don’t have many female friends and having no one to confide in or feel safe around has been really hard and causing me so much anxiety. I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone anymore because I’m so paranoid and worried someone is intentionally out to get me.
