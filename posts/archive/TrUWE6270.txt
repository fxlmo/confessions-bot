To all the Geologists in my Monday morning lecture... Shut the fuck up, sit back down, get off your high horse and go shag some silca rich rocks as you seem to mention them a lot. Never met such a cocky and arrogant group of people whom coincidentally are all clapped. Lots of love the whole of BSc Geography. (This is not an over reaction) x
