Petition to get the chain shops (Starbucks, costcutter, costa, tesco etc) off our campuses? Let's make way for small, local businesses and invest our money where it ought to be, not injecting it into some faceless, tax avoiding, planet wrecking giant. The uni definitely has sufficient funds to invest in these small local businesses and help them with the start up costs if necessary (without slapping on a load of interest for money loans)
