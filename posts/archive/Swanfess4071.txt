Seeing all these emails and posts from the uni about taxis and the sad situation we now find ourselves in as students is why I believe we should petition to have uber here. At least the journeys are recorded and you know who has been your driver, plus Swansea taxiâ€™s if booked can be unreliable or late throughout the day or may not even turn up because they have the monopoly on the market they know we will use them again.. time for a change on that time time for #UberSwansea
