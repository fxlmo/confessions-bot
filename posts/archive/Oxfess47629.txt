Why do so many performing art related societies have committees whose members are acting like they're elite/power hungry/want to run the show? Honestly baffles me that I won't be able to do my hobby because some people are too important and act threatened... And talk shit behind freshers backs...? Is that the impression you want to make on the new students? Sincerely, from a mature student who just wanted to do their hobby and they can't because of the undergraduate drama
