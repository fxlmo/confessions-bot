Not really a confession, just wanted to say a massive thank you to the lovely group of students who came over to check on me last night when I’d been spiked, and sat with me and kept me calm until they knew I was safe. I didn’t get any of your names unfortunately but I really appreciate it. Nice to know there are such lovely people out there, as the night could have ended a lot worse.
