I think I am struggling more than I would like to admit with regards to settling in at uni. I have not really found my people and the people in my flat are nice but I know I annoy them. The workload is getting harder to handle and I miss home more and more. I don't know how to cope and I think I am slipping towards an ed relapse I just feel so lost and alone but have no one I can talk to about it.
