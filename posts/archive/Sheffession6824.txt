My super pompous vegan flatmate has been winding me up recently, patronising me about recycling, contradicting everything I say - “to play devils advocate”, bringing druggie friends to our flat, and never doing the washing up. I’m super non confrontational and let everything slide so instead of solving the problem with a quick chat or even a text, I’ve swapped all his herbs. Cumin? No that’s curry powder! Parsley? Ahahaha it’s sage! Paprika?! CAYENE PEPER BITCH. Enjoy slightly unsatisfying meals from now on
