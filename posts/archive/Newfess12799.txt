So, I don't really care about Scottish Independence either way, but I was wondering: Scotland wanted another independence vote when Brexit was voted for (before Boris Johnson became PM). If Scotland left the UK, they wouldn't be a member of the EU - Brexit or no Brexit, so why is Brexit a factor in the push for Indyref2?
