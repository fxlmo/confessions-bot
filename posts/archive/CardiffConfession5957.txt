Don't even get me started on why you should be wearing a poppy. Think of something you hope for in your life ahead. Now reflect on how a hundred years ago and less, people our age with ambitions, plans, and similar hopes were called to go and fight and die. Cutting their lives short. As students we walk around takingâ€¦ More everything and our opportunity for granted. Alot of them would have dreamed to be here at university. Imagine how unlucky as a generation they were, it could've been us. They fought and sacrificed everything so that we have the opportunity to live out our hopes and dreams in freedom and not an enslaved world. If you want to be edgy and disrespect the poppy, use your brain and have some damn perspective. Though at the end of the day, you have the freedom to do so because of those our age giving up their whole lives for the likes of our generation.
