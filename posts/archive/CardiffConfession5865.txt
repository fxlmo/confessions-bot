who write for them too apparently but i think it's fun and I bet other people do too. I don't get the whole pryzm/story debate here because story does seem a little bit better than pryzm (personal preferences though) but I'm pretty sure I've seen the tab do a ton of photos from quids in as well? Just saw one of a guy jumbingâ€¦ More for a cheeseburger as the very first picture... (Feels kinda irrelevant, guess you'd know more though on the "inside" huh.) Funny how you'd wanna shoot the tab down but still use them to get into journalism (sounds kinda funny, hey?) Anyways, even if the tab did things just for the likes, most companies / news outlets do. If you want to get into journalism you should probably know by now that you write what people want to read (and throw in a few important things like expressing why climate change is real, why taking your vaccinations are important, why maybe we should stop pretending this planet is fine when it's clearly not, or EVEN politics.
