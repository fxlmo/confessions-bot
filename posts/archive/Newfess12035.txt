I’ve been quite sick for about two weeks, with a feverish cold that keeps me up at night. I feel awful about going to the doctors though, as I’ve seen all the news about the pressures on the NHS, I would hate to take up their time over what likely amounts to Freshers flu. Any ideas on how to cure myself?
