Can I get some advice please, what do you do about a landlord who has threatened to charge us extra for rent due to bills, even though they are included in the rent. There's nothing stating the bills have a cap or if exceed a certain amount they will charge extra in the letting agreement. What should me and my flatmates do about it?
