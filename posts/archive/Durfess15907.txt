hating tories isn't a popularity trait! stop looking down on people you perceive to have a certain political view. Not all tories are the same and its futile to think so -maybe if you actually engaged with people with different opinions to you instead of just going all cancel culture on them, you'd actually make headway with changingâ€¦ More people's views! But trying to shame them into silence from your self-elected moral high ground ain't it. When you wake up and realise that love-reacting "Vote for labour" fb profile pics and angry-reacting/hate commenting/defriending "vote for conservative" profile pics achieves literally nothing, I'll have more hope for us liberals :/
