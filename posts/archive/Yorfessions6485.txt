My mate went as a 1980s (20th century) hip hop gangster for Halloween ,and got with a girl in fibbers (nightclub) and gave her his gold (element atomic number 79) neck chain. That chain meant a lot to him and he wants to know who has it. If you have it please leave a comment below. Also what's the deal with that long necked goose on campus ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†
