If Corbyn was a true socialist he wouldn’t need to fund most of his proposals through borrowing. It’s really deceitful to offer spending increases while passing on the negatives of these policies, such as tax increases or spending cuts, to future governments. I’m all in favour of these spending increases but they should be funded properly through direct taxation in the wealthy of today, they’ve got enough money! I worry that increasing national debt will just give the tories an excuse for future austerity periods in the future.
