Bit awkward when people boast how they hate Nazis, the right wing and racists - then within the next 5 minutes proceed making Holocaust Jokes, Racist jokes, Anti Semetic and Anti-Zionist quips. Mock Muslims and then say "it was just a joke". If you find my religion, skin colour or the deaths of over 6 Million people funny, humanity has stopped to a new low. We need to stand up to each other more, even if it's our friends/flatmates. "It was just a joke" is not an excuse
