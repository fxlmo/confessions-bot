Don’t mean to have a moan, but how come all these random folk are strolling into the SU at 9pm on a Wednesday meaning that societies can’t get in after their socials as it’s too full. I get it’s a club but seriously societies pay AU membership, should at least get something back from that. Bullshit that we rock up at 10pm being told club won’t reopen til like 1am.
