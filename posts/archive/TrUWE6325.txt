Wtf can you actually do about roommates that trash the kitchen and NEVER clean it? If the bins fill up they just take the lid off and balance shit until it's falling onto the floor, then start piles. They leave out dirty stuff until they use everything in their drawers, and then only clean stuff when they need it. If they fill the sinkâ€¦ More with food so the water doesn't drain out, do they take it out the sink? Nope, they just move it to the corner. Anything that falls onto the hob is just left there for someone else to pick up once it is rotting.
