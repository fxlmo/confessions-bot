Three different girls, three different times. Had some spark with all of them until they asked me what course are you doing, and I replied with computer science. One girls facial expressions completely changed and rather than making out with me she went away and kissed some loser. Beware guys say anything except computer science to a girl when she asks about your course in the club.
