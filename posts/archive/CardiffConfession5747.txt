Yesterday I witnessed a girl sitting in the downstairs of the ASL and playing Mario Cart for what was about 4 hours, every time I looked up there she was, laptop out in front of her, doing nothing but seshing Mario Cart. Mario Cart girl I salute you, you may not pass your degree but you are the Queen of procrastination.
