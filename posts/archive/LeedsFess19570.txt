One of my friends has terrible personal hygiene. I have had to tell him twice that he smells really bad, that he should clean his clothes more often and maybe wear some perfume. He has not listened to me, and now I just can't stand to speak or sit next to him because of how bad he smells (has gotten worse over the weeks) and the fact he knows it. How do I convince him to smell nicer? He has bills included and a washing machine.
