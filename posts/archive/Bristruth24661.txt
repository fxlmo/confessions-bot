#Bristruth24580 Sorry mate, a history student here to burst your bubble. Robin Hood actually doesn't, historically, exist. There are in fact records that trace a figure called Robin Hod/ Robert of Wetherby back to 1262. He was a serious criminal on the run, but the closest that history can find to be Robin Hood. The most likelyâ€¦ More candidate for the Sheriff of Nottingham character was actually the Sheriff of Yorkshire; Eustace of Lowdham. He was ordered to hunt down and hang Robert with a chain.
