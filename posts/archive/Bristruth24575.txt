i used to be such a confident and self-assured person before coming to bristol - but for some reason it's all gone out the window :/ i have a couple of really good mates in my flat but ive been cripplingly shy when it comes to talking to coursemates. i feel like people have defo noticed im a bit of a loner in lectures and seminarsâ€¦ More so im feeling quite pessimistic about reinventing myself. i don't have anything against my coursemates or an inferiority complex, though i haven't met any who i have much in common with. ive been skipping workshops bc im afraid of the group work and i've even developed a stutter ffs. has anyone been in the same situation? feel like pure shit just want a shred of charisma back
