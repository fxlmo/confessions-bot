I just wanted to say a massive screw you to LMH. If throwing out all my possessions "accidentally" when I was barely struggling to live paycheck to paycheck wasn't enough, breaking confidentiality and informing people of my situation - people I specifically requested for my own benefit and theirs you didn't tell - definitely went aâ€¦ More step too far. My thoughts and feelings matter. You've taken me away from a group of people I love like family. For a college who prides itself on welfare and access, you really did well by giving me one day's notice that I was going home, or I was being sectioned. You really know how to care for your students.
