As somebody who seriously questions the validity of much of the climate change 'science', it's nice to see that the uni's newspaper agrees that it is a matter of debate. While the university might support the ramblings of Greta Thunberg and other leftist rubbish, it's refreshing to read that Gair Rhydd disagree. Hope to see more like this in the future!
