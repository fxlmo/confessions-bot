My girlfriend just told me I'm like Ross from friends a few days ago. She thought this was a compliment and that Ross is one of the best characters. Ross is the worst character in friends. After a year, he completely gives up on Ben. He cheats on Rachel. Just not a likable person, not caring or considerate. So to prove this to my girlfriend, I've told her we're on a break and shagged her flatmate. She now agrees Ross is the worst. 1-0 me.
