been going to the maths/CAE cafe on bay for much needed extra help with matlab etc, the people in there were saying that the uni needs em to get us to fill out this survey etc so that they can show the uni that they actually help students otherwise they might close the cafes down. which is a joke, they need more cafe hours/times and a bigger space with more demonstrators. it would be a huge loss if they got closed down
