I started uni with freshers flu which developed into pneumonia. My asthma has held me back in life so much, Iâ€™ve had to miss nights out to go on a nebuliser, had to skip my winter birthday because I canâ€™t drink on antibiotics, had to spend weekends in bed due to the flu jab, having to rest and stay warm so as not to have a chestâ€¦ More infection. Itâ€™s so shit. I hoped uni would be different but it wasnâ€™t. I missed so many society nights out and felt so lonely. But Iâ€™m well now and my flatmate offered to come with me to Spanish society tonight so I wouldnâ€™t be alone. I was so nervous about going. I nearly bailed. Iâ€™m hideously shy as it is and I hadnâ€™t been to a society night before. Didnâ€™t think I could do it. But I turned up and SOMEHOW I managed to win best dressed at day of the dead and nothing has ever meant so much to me ðŸ˜­ thank you to everyone who made tonight so brilliant, the Hispanic society is so welcoming and kind.
