Just hit me how lonely I am here. Thought I was doing okay but honestly I just feel so sad and alone all the time, I'm just getting better at hiding or ignoring it. If things don't improve I don't want to come back next term. Can you apply to other unis while still at uni? Not sure I can cope with staying here but I still do need a degree
