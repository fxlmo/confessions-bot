“tHaNkS fOr EnDiNg bRiTiSh hErItAgE”... pretty sure that if you look around London, many of the buildings are paid for by slave trade, road names are named after slave traders- slave trade was a huge part of our British heritage but you don’t see anyone crying that it’s ended. Pls bring yourself forwards to the 21st century. If you really miss shooting that bad I’m sure there are some pheasant costumes available online. Shoot each other instead.. good riddance
