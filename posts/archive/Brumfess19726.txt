As a second year, every day goes by and I gradually lose confidence in my own abilities to make friends. No matter how hard I try to appear friendly around others, it just seems like nobody cares about me or wants to make an effort to talk to me unless I talk to them. And the only people I can be confident around is my own family whoâ€¦ More I only see once every month. Yes, I'm in loads of societies and I go to events on a regular basis but it's so hard keeping this air of positivity about you when you have nothing to feel positive about. It's just been a constant cycle of trying to show that you're on top, and then going back and having that reality check of feeling terrible again.
