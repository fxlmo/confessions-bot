The other night in my drunken state I made the wonderful decision that all of us make at some point in their lives: to hook up with my ex. He lives much further away from town than me, so I decided to try and sneak him back to mine without my housemates knowing so I wouldn’t get the lecture about my questionable life decisions in… More the morning. After a successful ‘sneaking in’ everything was going smoothly, that is until I was woken up at around 9am the following morning by a loud banging noise coming from the floor above me and noticed my ex boyfriend was nowhere to be seen... turns out he had gone and got himself locked in our bathroom and it took 3 of us and a good 20mins to get him back out again. When the door finally opened and my housemates gathered to see who it was, he emerged wearing my pink fluffy dressing gown... SUBTLE.
