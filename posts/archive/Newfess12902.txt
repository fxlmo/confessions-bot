So every time a girl comes onto me or a friend or family try to have a heart to heart with me, I do everything I can to try and escape the situation due to anxiety. Looked online and apparently it’s a ‘fear of intimacy’ (can’t find a phobia). Anyone got any advice for dealing with this sort of thing? Help a guy out :)
