Oh, the struggles of doing year abroad... I didn’t get into a relationship last year, so if I get into one this year we’ll have been together less than a year before I move to another country for a year, and if I get a French boyfriend I’ll have to come back to England after less than a year together, and if I get one in my final year at Bristol we’ll also end up living long distance when we get jobs after graduating... so basically I’m going to die alone because I’m doing a year abroad. Thanks, year thirteen me.
