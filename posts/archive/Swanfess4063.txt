After a very powerful conversation with some friends, I have to remind everyone to register to vote. The election falls on the 12th of december, a time when students are going to be on the move trying to get home from uni for christmas, a time when the government has rudely assumed that we won't be available to vote. So get yourself registered asap and read some manifestos because I don't believe that the election falling at such a chaotic time for students is a coincidence.
