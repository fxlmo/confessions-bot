Vegan here to apologise on behalf of all the NORMAL vegans who have to deal with the absolute psychos out here giving us a bad name by comparing eating meat to eating children (the wildest take I’ve seen tbh) and being so entitled to think they have a right to decide what others eat smh. I promise y’all we aren’t all like this,… More I’ll happily educate someone on my values, why I choose to be vegan etc but only if THEY ask, I’m not about to try and control their diet/values cuz that ain’t it chief 🙏🏻
