I’m doing a Masters right and I love my course but the people on there are absolute wetwipes. Most of the students on the course but me come from Russell group unis like Exeter, Bristol and Warwick uni. I fucking shit u not, 1 of them said ‘yah yah’ in a lecture n I locked eyes with the professor like what the actual fuck. Anyway, I haven’t made no pals. Sit on my own in lectures and wondering why they’ve chosen to do their masters in Swansea????
