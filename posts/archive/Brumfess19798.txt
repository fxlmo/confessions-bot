I'm a having relationship troubles at the moment and I'm honestly so confused and hurt by things as two misinterpreteded situations have potentially ruined the relationship. All I've done is my best to continue making contact, being pleasant and apologising for anything I've said that's been misinterpreted. All I can do is wait andâ€¦ More continue to be pleasant but it's taking such a toll on me.
