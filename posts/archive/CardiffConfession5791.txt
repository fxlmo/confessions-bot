@ the girls in the SU last night who didnâ€™t have a radar key to get into the disabled toilets but were banging on the door for us to hurry up even though I had a radar key - if you donâ€™t have a disability then donâ€™t use the disabled toilets and DONâ€™T make people feel bad for using themðŸ™„ itâ€™s hard enough being disabled and especially when you donâ€™t look it!!!
