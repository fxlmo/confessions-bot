Can everyone please be a bit nicer to your bar workers? Running away with drinks you haven’t paid for, begging us for free shots, shouting at us because you don’t agree with the price of your drink etc. - it’s all really shitty to deal with. Most of us are minimum wage workers who would rather be elsewhere. Please just buy your drinks and step away from the bar when you’ve been served, it’ll make our evenings so much easier.
