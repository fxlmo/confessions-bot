During roar I needed to go to the toilet and so like any girl you drag your best pal in with you for some company. I sat on the toilet only assuming I would do a quick wee but instead a huge alcho-poo slid out. Slowly the toxic smell filled the cubicle and I warned my friend that it was a bad one in advance. She took one whiff and instantly vomited all over the toilet floor. The smell was horrendous. Honestly it was a bonding moment we wonâ€™t forget.
