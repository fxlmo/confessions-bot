now that I am behind on work, i am losing sleep to catch up, which makes me less productive because I am tired, which makes me less sociable, also because I have work to do, which makes me depressed because I am alone, which makes me tired, which makes me unproductive, which makes me behind on work. its such a destructive cycle that'sâ€¦ More ruining my life. I spend hours every day just sitting there, doing nothing and thinking about every thing that i haven't done, while NOT DOING ANY OF THEM, being unable to overcome my procrastination that stems from a fear of doing things badly, which only results in me DOING THINGS BADLY at the last minute. pls explain
