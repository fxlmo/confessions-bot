I have been pranking my house mates constantly and they have all started blaming each other. I have now caused a war between them and none of them suspect it is me . It is getting a bit out of hand with some of them putting cracked eggs in peoples beds as well as dead flies .Should I confess or continue to cause havoc and sit back and watch ?
