Halloween is coming up and a lot of people will be out drinking. This is just a friendly reminder for everyone to please be aware of your limits and look after your friends. Many things can go wrong when you are intoxicated past your ability to either make sensible decisions or walk properly. This is not ideal, as there are a lot of riversides and it can end more deadly than just embarrassing stories. #staysafe #consentmatters
