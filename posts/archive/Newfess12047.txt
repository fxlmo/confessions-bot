Iâ€™ve just come back to uni after a year out and Iâ€™m really stressing about finding people to live with for next year. Any advice? All my pals are graduating and I want to find a decent group of girls who love a good night out or movie sesh, not end up with a bunch of randomers. Thanks in advanceðŸ’“
