Hey, so CPS has done a skeevy thing by asking that people let them in to have visits with a maximum of an hours notice, this is really illegal so I've attached a quick draft of an email Iâ€¦ More sent in response that basically tells them to go fuck themselves in legal jargon - Remember your rights kids, don't let them push you around and remember, if you can sue them, you're a hero.
