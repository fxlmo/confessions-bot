Everyone says they find their partners at uni, feel like there was so much pressure. But I'm happy now just working hard in my 20s for my career with 2 dogs. Then panicking at 30/35 that I'll be all alone and just settle down with an equally desperate 30/35 year for the rest of my life, having 2 kids and 2 dogs. Side tracked, but is that an uncommon opinion? Just cba and don't think finding 'the one' will happen here
