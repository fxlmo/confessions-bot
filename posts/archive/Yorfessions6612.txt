We all pay 9-21 grand to be here, a lot of us have jobs just to afford basic living costs, so why does the new vice chancellor keep sending us emails asking us to donate to the university!?!?! We already pay you and can barely afford that - we can't afford to pay for scholarships for other students too. It's important scholarships exist but they're looking at the wrong people to pay.
