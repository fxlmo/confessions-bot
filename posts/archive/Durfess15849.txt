Looking for advice: So I have this friend who I've known since school and recently she's been acting super weird. We fell out for a while and since we've been speaking again she's told me that I'm patronising (for trying to accommodate her), while talking to me like a lost child, and said she thinks I view her as some sort of backupâ€¦ More plan, while waiting until the last minute 'to see if she's free' before declining whenever I try to make plans. She's also cancelled plans without telling me and just left me waiting while she's gone to sleep or seen another friend. I recently found out that she got into a new relationship around the time this behaviour started, but her partner seems perfectly nice and she's completely infatuated.
