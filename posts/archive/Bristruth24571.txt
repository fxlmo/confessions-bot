What do I do when I feel alienated by my flat and that they don’t want me around? It’s like they’re deliberately excluding me from simple things that they do together, I’m never invited to nights out or when they’re socialising. Where’s a good place to make friends and spend some time rather than being alone in my room feeling miserable?
