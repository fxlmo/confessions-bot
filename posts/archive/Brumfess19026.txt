I genuinely don't understand how people can spend so much going clubbing, someone said they spend £30 per night like wtf??? That's double my weekly budget and you spend it all in one night???? I don't get money from my parents so like are people's parents sending them £100 a week or something ridiculous??? Imagine being rich
