A coursemate just said to me that I have a cheerful and smiley face that makes her happy, and told me to not stop smiling. It was a very sweet gesture and probably one of the best compliments that I have ever received. As someone who actually struggling with depression who often masked my true feelings, it just brought back the hopes and strengths that I felt were fading away from me.
