starting uni has actually been the weirdest experience of my life. I’ve always found it easy to get on with people and i would say my personality is quite likeable, im social and outgoing yet for some reason i’ve found it extremely hard to make decent friends. Unfortunately for me my flat just aren’t my type of people, theyre… More nice enough but they dont go out and are quite introverted... since most people make their closest friends through the flats i feel like its put me at a massive disadvantage. dont get me wrong i have made friends and go out regularly but i have no ‘close’ friends where i can just randomly go chill with them, as they all have their own friendship groups so i always feel like im on the side. ive joined societies to try and branch out but the same thing occurs- casual one night friendships. will things change? or has my lack of luck in the flatmate department ruined my opportunity for the rest of uni as i feel people stick in their flat groups for the 3 years :/
