Girls- important questions here. I’ve recently started a relationship and need a better solution to grooming down there. Waxing is very expensive and doesn’t last thaaat long, shaving doesn’t last either and is painful. I just want a low maintenance and affordable solution that means I’m not constantly fixing up, and don’t have to think about whether I’m ‘ready’ every evening. Being a girl is hard.
