About the LGBT debate - I think that not wanting straight/cis people to be at an event that is, at its core, not for them is fine! It’s not for you! Cishet people who cry about inclusivity whenever LGBT people ask them to leave us alone are trying to make our issues their issues - it’s like if a white person turned up at an event… More specifically for POC, related to being POC and cried about how they didn’t feel included — you don’t feel included because you’re not!! This is about us and for us - I’m not calling you all raging homophobes but you’re so used to everything being for you that you’re claiming exclusion and oppression when someone has, respectfully, asked that you go somewhere else and leave us to it. They’re not saying you can’t support us they’re just pointing out that most of you only actively engage in that “support” when you have something to gain from it - when you can dance and get drunk and claim allyship without doing any work. The first Pride was a riot and unless you’re willing to throw bricks at the police for us I don’t want you there.
