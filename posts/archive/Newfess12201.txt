So I recently came out as bi to my mother. And to say the least she wasn't supportive, we're a relatively traditionalist but not strict Catholic family. And now I'm debating whether or not to come out to my friends. The thing is I'm pretty sure some of them would be supportive. However I've an equal if not greater number of friends who come from similar-ish backgrounds to me who I don't think would support me.
