Recently I’ve been seeing someone but whenever we have sex I finish really early, I’ve never really had this problem before with other girls, but don’t know how to last longer?? Obviously it’s shit for her when I finish quickly and not great for me either... I try to meet her needs with foreplay but it’s really bothering me that this keeps happening when it hasn’t before! Has anyone else experienced this, is it just a phase kind of thing or what can I do to help me last longer again?????
