I have been to half a dozen foreign countries, and I have never had random english words shouted at me by anyone above the age of 10. The fact this this university has had a long series of incidents where random chinese words were shouted at random east asian students on the street, by students twice that age and meant to represent some of our most intelligent and best educated, is amongst other things a discrace upon our country.
