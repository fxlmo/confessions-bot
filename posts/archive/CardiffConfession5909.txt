It’s November and that means some of you have started looking for houses. After renting in Cathays for 3 years here’s a general rule of thumb that many might miss out: if you really like the one of the houses during house viewings, always go back to the same house without the letting agent present and ask what the current… More tenants think about their landlord/ letting agent. Most of us will be more than happy to tell you but too afraid to tell you when their letting agent is there
