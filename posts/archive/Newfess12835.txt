I've cut all ties with my "best friend" of 16 years. We used to be super close when we were younger but we've recently drifted apart. We make no effort with eachother, we hardly even speak at all. I feel like within the last year or so, We've only stayed friends because we've survived 16 years, so why end it now? The final straw wasâ€¦ More we were supposed to be going to a gig together and she cancelled on mare me a week before we were due to go. I stressed about selling the tickets so we could at least get our money back. I watch her snapchat story last night and she's gone to the same gig with her other friend. Her excuse for cancelling on me was that she was broke but she has enough money to go with someone else? Am I over reacting or is that super shady? Maybe it seems petty but this has been happening for years now. I love her to pieces but she's a shit friend, shes toxic and manipulative. It feels like I've broken up with someone but I think it's for the best
