Calling all students that attended the SU Halloween freaks fest last night - can someone PLEASE tell me where it all went wrong and why on earth I ended up in someone’s cellar at 4am? With scratches on my arm? Having spent £80? Also - to the random Male that got a taxi to HAND DELIVER my phone after I lost it, thank you, legend. Lots of love from the rogue police woman.
