#Yorfessions6509 I think you should let noisy neighbours (kids or drunk uni students or whoever) know if they're loud during times when people are normally sleeping, like 11pm-8am. However, I definitely recommend the library or a cafe for studying since it wouldn't be reasonable to expect silence during "normal" daytime hours :)
