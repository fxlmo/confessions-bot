All of you amateur politicians need to go check out full fact. Literally everything Boris and Jeremy say is some level of a lie. No, 200,000 nurses havent left the NHS since 2010, theres more nurses working in the NHS now than there were then. We also have no idea how much labours spending will cost. The 1.2 Trillion figure is based on some pretty big assumptions. Let fullfact into your life and become the based and redpilled skeptic kings and queens you were born to be.
