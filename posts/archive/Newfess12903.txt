How do you find people to live with in second year? Everyone I've approached is already in with another group of friends so I'm scared I'm going to be on my own. I really can't afford a studio and also I'm worried that if I live on my own I'll just never go out or interact with other people so will miss out on a bunch of stuff or just have a really shit second year and lose what little social life I have already
