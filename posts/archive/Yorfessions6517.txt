Could somebody pls give me advice on 2nd year living bcos Im concerned that I don’t have anyone to live with bcos Im not close with/don’t really get on with my flat and I feel like my close university friends have already made plans with their own flats :-( i don’t want to be left alone and have to live with strangers again. Im just feelin like I’m the only 1 worried about it...
