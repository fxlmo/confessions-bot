Really wanna make more friends. Like my housemates and I are fine and we get along but I just don’t feel I fit. I try elsewhere and I just think none of my jokes land or people just avoid hanging out and it’s actually kind of starting to get a bit demotivating. I just want a good group of friends ngl but none of that fake uni friend bs. Anyone else?
