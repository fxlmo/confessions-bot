I live in university accommodation on a residential road surrounded by an electronic gate and doors. Recently two bicycles were stolen from a bike rack within the gated area. This makes me think that someone either tailgated a student to gain access to the property, or scaled the fence, or perhaps even stole a bod card to get access toâ€¦ More the property (unless it was an inside job!) Either way, as someone who has been a victim of crimes in the past the thought of having thieves lurking within a gated university accommodation area makes me extremely nervous.
