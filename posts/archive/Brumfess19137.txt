Me and my long term girlfriend have been using the morning after pill as contraception for a year or so now. We only have sex probably twice a week so after each time she takes the morning after pill, but after telling my housemates this they said it we shouldnâ€™t be and it could be harmful? Opinions and suggestions please, neither of us are fans of condoms
