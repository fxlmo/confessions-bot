My friend ignores my messages all the time. Like I could ask them a question and they can still point blank ignore me. I then get a message after a week or so like “I haven’t seen you in ages I’ve been busy recently” and then we talk. My life is way busier than theirs but I always make time to talk to them but I never get the same… More treatment. It’s really getting me down like it only takes 2 second to reply and say can I talk to you later or miss you busy right now. I’ve already told them I hate being ignored but they keep giving me shit excuses. Any advice ?
