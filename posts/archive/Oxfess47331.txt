Is it just me, or are KeepCups straight up garbage? The lid never goes on properly (whose idea was it to have a travel cup without a screw-on lid??) and every time I walk holding one coffee leaks out onto my hand. Plus you can't put it in your bag even when empty bc as soon as it goes upside down the lid falls off. Love having to pay Â£15 to use a cup infinitely worse than the one i already owned ðŸ™ƒ thanks Oxford
