Jesus christ, imagine being offended by a climate change denier having their argument put in the COMMENT section of a newspaper, (alongside the mainstream, scientific argument btw). Its a free country & a free press so if a controversial view is shared, it is far more open to scrutiny and ridicule. Conveying an alternative take in a world of vanilla views & snowflake-student offense is therefore a big dick move. Uppa Gair Rhydd
