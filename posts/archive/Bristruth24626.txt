Why is every social so revolved around drinking? It’s almost like people nowadays are so boring they NEED alcohol to actually have fun. Yes alcohol can be involved within the social but please don’t make it the main factor of the event- It really discourages people like me from turning up and trying to get to know my fellow society members. Sincerely, a first year who doesn’t drink.
