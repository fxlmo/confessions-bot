I want to be a good friend and I get that friendships that “just work” are great but it breaks my heart when people say they like/want a friendship where you might just not speak for days or weeks but when you do it’s really good. I feel like I have to put in almost all of the effort and whilst the other person is happily not speaking,… More secure in the knowledge that you’re a friend they can rely on, you’re trying to work out a reason for the radio silence. I feel like the decision to have a relationship like that is always one sided and made without considering what the other person wants/needs.
