So lecturers highly likely going on strike again... For 3rd years this is the second time our lectures are getting cancelled and we're likely to yet again not see any compensation or refunds for the fees we continue to pay to receive nothing. Not testing us on content not covered is a sick way of saying impact was mitigated. We. Won'â€¦ Moret. Get. The. Lectures. We. Are. Paying. For!!! Students Union - do something about getting us meaningful compensation! Sticking some random mouldy sheets around campus about #RippedOff is cosmetic. This is something we really need your help on! Otherwise we're all going to be paying a small fortune for nothing - AGAIN!
