I am aware of the mental well-being services at the University and SU but feel they aren’t helping much and wanted to breach out for anonymous help. I was sexually assaulted last year here at Cardiff, by a stranger, but a student, and I am finding it hard to face seeing them on SU nights and walking around University day to day. I don’t have the strength to do this everyday but refuse to drop out and let it ruin my life. What can I do?
