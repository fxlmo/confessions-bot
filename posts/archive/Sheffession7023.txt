Imagine show and tell at uni, ‘bring in something that means a lot to you’. Sarah brings in the two forks and a knife that she managed to not lose in first year. James brings in a photo of that time he actually managed to get a seat in the library. Kelly brings in the dildo she keeps under the bed and Will brings in some ket and everyone does lines off the table. Absolute carnage.
