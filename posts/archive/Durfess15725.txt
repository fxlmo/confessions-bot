How do people honestly deal with catered meals. Like today I skipped two meals because I had no one to go with and didn’t want the super fun experience of eating alone, or cramping the style of people who actually know each other. I really wanted self catered but that isn’t what I was allocated and now I’m pretty miserable a good… More portion of the time. Just wanted to know if anyone else has this huge fear of going to the college dining room because I’m reaching the point of wanting to order food every night and eat it alone in my room (which is something I can not afford).
