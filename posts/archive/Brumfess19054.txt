Thank you to the guy with the glasses who was walking with his girlfriend past the library today when I collided with a bike. You were being kind and I was appreciative of your words but I was a bit grumpy! Hope you two have a good week - you deserve it! P.S. I even managed to make it on time to my lecture so things are looking up for me.
