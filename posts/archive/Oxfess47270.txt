Oxford is just a perfect place for me. Why? Everyone is crying because they cant keep up with work and be social while I dont feel like being around people and having a bunch of work makes it reasonable. Yeye I know that avoiding people is bad and lead to social anxiousness but I think I feel really good digging my own grave. I'll tell you if I become suicidal bc Im lonely in moments when I feel like being sociable (y).
