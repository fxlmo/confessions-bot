Some advice on noisy neighbours please... I don’t want to be a dick because my neighbours have five kids (most of then under the age of 6, we suspect). I’d expect and tolerate noise if it weren’t constant constant screaming and shouting whether it’s 8 in the morning or 3 in the afternoon. I can’t focus in my own room, and it’s… More woken me up and stopped me falling asleep before. My room is on ground floor, probably right next to their living room. I’m at my wits end, but feel like there’s nothing I can do... their parents are probably at their wits end as well. any suggestions would be welcome.
