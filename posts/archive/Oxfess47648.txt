sick and tired of never feeling good enough to approach either of the two main groups in hugh's 2nd year :(( I get they both seem like a nice and friendly group of girls on the outside (At least one group anyway) but all I can focus on is how pretty and confident they all are and I find it so intimidating- I feel like amongstâ€¦ More themselves they're so judgemental and will never take you seriously unless you're as pretty as them or as confident which is really tough bc I'm neither of those things. Wish we had more inclusivity in the year, and I wish that those who were more confident and outgoing would make more of an effort to include those on the outside :(
