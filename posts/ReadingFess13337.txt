OK can someone please tell me how to flirt with guys? Literally every time an attractive guy comes up to me on a night out, I start rambling about my course, or my family or my freaking cats! ðŸ˜­and Iâ€™ve seen girls who literally flirt so well! Like theyâ€™re playful and teasing and drop in really smooth sly innuendos, but HOW DO THEY DO IT??
