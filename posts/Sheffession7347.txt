Moving into endcliffe last year I met my flatmate for the first time, and her mum. That night my flatmate told me she was gay, but that she hadn't come out to her parents yet as she was unsure how they'd react. Throughout the year, every time she went home her mum (who I'd only ever met that one time) would drop hints about how weâ€¦ More should become a couple. I'm a guy, so obviously it wouldn't quite work out... Eventually her whole family started trying to set us up. Fast forward to May and her 12 year old cousin randomly messages me telling me how much my flatmate fancies me and how she's madly in love (including a rather bizarre message about how she likes my 'normal brown boy hair', whatever that means). I was trying to think of a way of telling this girl "I'm not quite your cousin's type" without outing her to her familyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
