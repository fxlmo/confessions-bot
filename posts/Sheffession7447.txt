For some extra information about #Sheffession7408 who is probably about my mate. For a medic tradition, two of our medic friends were getting "married" as they were going to have some medic kids. So we had a stag do and were drinking all day, then going to corp to have the wedding. At 8pm we got to bar one to start our second barâ€¦ More crawl of the day, where me and the person in question were very wasted and feeling a bit peaky. I left to go and calmly throw up in the toilet, where I made no mess whatsoever. How ever, my mate is a messy drunk, and was half way through a crap when he felt the urge to throw up.
