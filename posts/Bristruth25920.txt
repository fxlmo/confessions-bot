Other people pick up habits like smoking, drugs and heavy drinking at uni. As someone who grew up in the middle of nowhere who could never have food delivered, my uni habits are as follows: dominos delivery, delivery, justeat and Uber eats. I can’t stop. I’ve ordered dominos at 3am just because I couldn’t sleep. I was sober. I am in a vicious circle and I simply cannot resist the temptation. Please help
