Me and my girlfriend are chilling in bed watching a film and when the film ends I decide to put one of those long videos of a fire on the tv, being the romantic boyfriend I am. Things start to heat up (excuse the pun) and before you know it we’re mid sex when all of a sudden an advert comes on at full volume!! By far the biggest mood killer I’ve ever experienced so thank you YouTube for being the ultimate cock block
