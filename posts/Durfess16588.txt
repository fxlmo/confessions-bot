Fresher here looking for some advice to help me next term. I don't really get along with my flatmates (I have barely spoken to them at all), but the person in the room next door to me regularly has sex with his girlfriend late at night. I, of course, have no issues with this, but as the walls are so thin I can hear EVERYTHING, which is somewhat off putting when it is at 1am and I'm trying to sleep. I have no idea how to approach this issue, especially as I barely know said boy's name... any advice?
