Although it was entertaining, Rise of Skywalker is the most creatively bankrupt Star Wars film and isnâ€™t much more than 2 hours of unexplained, shoehorned fan fiction plot elements that undermine not only the past two films, but also the original trilogy. Definitely a crowd pleaser but plays it incredibly safe to do exactly what a very vocal and hateful part of the fanbase demanded.
