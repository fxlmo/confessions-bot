Can men please stop being so fucking creepy in clubs please? Touching women when they clearly don't want it (my ass was grabbed twice tonight), not backing off when they're clearly not interested, and when someone says they're a lesbian don't fucking ask for proof or make a perverted comment! I'm honestly so fucking sick of the entitled attitude - just because I'm dancing or I'm attractive doesn't mean I'm free game. Educate yourselves on how to do better. If you're old enough to be in a club, you're old enough to know better.
