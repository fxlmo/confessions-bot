Ok people, we have a final winner! After months of looking we finally agreed: we have a "LIBRARY QUEEN" everybody! We were looking for a good looking gal but also kinda nerdy, sociable but also works well alone, so we released our stalkers. So, she has long blonde hair, green eyes, kinda fit, she wears black glasses when using theâ€¦ More laptop (apple, with blue case), she's always on 2nd floor. We couldn't read the whole student ID but she does BA Drama and English, course ending in 2021. Her name finishes with "CHIO" Or "HIO", Agent 075 couldn't read it soz.
