Maintenance came into our flat this morning and stole the Pedestrian sign from our corridor that pointed to our kitchen. We decided to go steal another one from the building work outside again, to just find the exact same sign on the side, this has now been returned to its rightful place in our flat. What others in Allen Court should learn from this is that maintenance are dicks and you should hide all the signs, cones and barriers you have stolen if you know they are coming. :)
