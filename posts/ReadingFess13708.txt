To anyone who struggles with mental heath, anxiety or any other mental related struggle and has tried talking to friends family just go to a psychiatrist I have been going since I was 16 and it is doing wonders for me!! It would help you so much as you can tell them absolutely anything even things you don't feel comfortable sharing with your friends and family
