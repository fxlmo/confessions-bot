I was glad to see that there was some discussion today between pro-choice and pro-life, that is so healthy and refreshing to see. What is not, however, is people spewing hate towards each other over facebook through these posts. I personally don't think it's very healthy, and is really affecting me mentally to see so muchâ€¦ More unhealthy disagreement and our student body being so divided. If you are actually genuine in your beliefs and want to have an honest healthy discussion, please reach out to the person who disagrees with you to talk about it in person! People's intentions and meanings can so easily be mis-interpreted over text conversations. If you don't think it's worth the time, then I kindly ask you to move on and start submitting funny student memes and hilarious SU stories! #MakeCardiffConfessionsUnitedAgain
