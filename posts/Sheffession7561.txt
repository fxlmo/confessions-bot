To the lovely and amazing girl who helped me at the Shapes #1 event at DINA Venue, thank you so so much. You didn't even know who I was and you were so kind and I'm so sorry that you had to see me in such a state. You made me feel so safe, and I can't thank you enough for being there for me and helping out a complete stranger. I'mâ€¦ More really sad I don't remember our conversation or your name, and you are clearly a great person and I'd love to thank you personally. If you prefer to not reveal who you are then I just want you to know that you were such a life saver. I was immensely inebriated and if it weren't for you, I would have probably been unconcious on the floor for a long time.
