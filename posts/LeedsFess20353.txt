Took me 4 years but I finally gave up and searched it, so for those wondering like me, the squiggly boi next to the Christmas tree is an art installation labelled as ‘A Sign for Art’. The artist used to work with deaf-blind adults as an art instructor. Drawing two spaced fingertips in a wave motion across the forehead indicated the arrival of the artist or the imminent activity of making art. This sign stuck with the artist and is what inspired this sculpture.
