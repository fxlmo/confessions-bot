I'm genuinely concerned about one of my housemates. She has a developed an all-cosuming Co-op addiction and I don't know how to help her. She sometimes goes up to 4 times a day, just to buy their double-chocolate chip cookies. Her latest hobby is exploring the different Co-ops around Bristol, and yesterday went to one in Clifton, Whiteladies, and Gloucester road. What should I do?
