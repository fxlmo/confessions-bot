When I first got my placement through uni put a lecture on about how to act in the workplace and their first point was don’t sleep with people you work with. Fast forward 6 months to the morning after our Christmas party waking up next to the fit guy in my office, even on my placement I’m still not listening to lectures #sorrynotsorry
