Voting isn't marriage - it's public transport. You're not waiting for "the one" which is absolutely perfect. You are getting the bus. And if there isn't one going exactly to your destination, you don't stay at home and sulk - you take the one going closest to where you want to be. ðŸ’• (N.b. I didn't come up with this advice but its brilliant)
