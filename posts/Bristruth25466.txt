Starting to slip into a bit of a depressive episode. Didn’t think it was that bad as I am functioning ok and lows can happen now and then, but i am visiting home and last night i just got way too drunk to appreciate my friends’ company who I hadn’t seen in 2 months. I’m disappointed in myself for that. I haven’t had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol for years until now. I’m not sure who to talk to when i feel down at uni, i just tend to hang out with people and act normal.
