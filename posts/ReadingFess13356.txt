Honestly feel like I don't fit in anywhere, all my friends have better friends and I don't get included in anything. See my uni friends and work friends out on Instagram stories and I'm not there, gf has loads of other friends and don't wanna bother her just because I'm jealous. wanna be positive in 2020 but been like this forever and just don't know how to be when anyone gets close as I don't have much positive experiences with it.
