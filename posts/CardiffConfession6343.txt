I know people from different places can have a very different outlook on cultures/people from around the world. One thing I noticed significantly when I arrived here, is that a lot of Cardiff students are not very multicultural. I've been previously described as someones first friend of colour. I don't get how you can haveâ€¦ More the academic background to get into a good uni like Cardiff and not know about other cultures in this world. There's plenty of people I've met who have had so little opportunities compared to us and live in essentially poverty but they know so much the British culture, which defeats the argument of British people saying they haven't been exposed to foreign cultures. Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.
