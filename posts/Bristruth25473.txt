Hi, I'm a first year who's been having a bit of a tough time regarding my mental wellbeing lately and my GP suggested that I join a society and try and do some exercise to better my mood. Are there any casual sport or exercise related societies that are still accepting members? Cheap or free membership would be nice but it's not a must. Thanks guys
