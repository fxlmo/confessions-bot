#TrUWE I don't know if you're gonna see this and tbh this is the only way i know how to reach out without it being weird... but i regret being so stupid last year and not trying harder. I miss you and annoying you by begging you to put up your fairy lights up and then getting angry when you would take them down and having you walk me to the bus stop at 2am because I never wanted to go on my own... message me if you see thisss
