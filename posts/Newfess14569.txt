I really want to do medicine and be a doctor. Don’t get me wrong I am enjoying my current course but I’ve always thought about medicine and felt jealous of the medics. The problem is that I suffer from panic attacks that have no obvious pattern so I really don’t think I’d be able to do medicine. Any advice?
