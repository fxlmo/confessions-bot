Anyone in that kind of frame of mind where they are always thinking of friends and I'm always saying something related to friends. Like I'll be say in a lecture and I say something and thing oh i take it I'm funny like Chandler today. Or no matter what I'm doing I'd rather go back and watch friends and sleep Nope? Okay
