To all the freshies, honestly wait till January at least to arrange who you’re gonna live with. You may think you’ve found the housemates of your dreams, I thought I had but now I’m stuck with a bunch of absolute cunts and we argue all the time. Some people told us to wait and we laughed in their face - couldn’t have been more wrong. The houses won’t be all gone, just wait a bit longer, trust me!
