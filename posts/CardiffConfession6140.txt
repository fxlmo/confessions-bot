The whole abortion debate recently has been really, really triggering for myself, someone who had to have an abortion a few years ago and still thinks about it all the time. I’m so glad I wasn’t around uni today so didn’t have to see the bullshit fake pictures (and they are fake, as someone who has had an abortion... it did not look like that whatsoever). However, I’m so proud of all the students who took the time to censor them with cardboard/standing in front of them and by debating them. You’re fucking amazing❤️❤️❤️
