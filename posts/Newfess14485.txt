Please check up on your friends guys, especially if you know they have a history of mental health. I’ve been struggling so much and there’s two people who I used to be so close with at uni who haven’t checked in for a long time and it’s such a blow because I’m too scared to reach out again because I don’t want to accept it’s happening for the second time. Literally a ‘you ok?’ Would be such a relief to know someone cares
