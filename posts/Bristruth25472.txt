Does anyone else realise just how much fucking pressure it is being an international student, moving to another country, half the world away from everything you know, studying, taking care of yourself, trying to get a fucking job, maintaining a relationship, having friends all while trying to stay healthy and sane? Does anyone quite comprehend how much fucking pressure that is?
