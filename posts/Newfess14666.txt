This guy asked me out when I was drunk and I said yes and have gone along with it out of not wanting to hurt his feelings. We have been going out for about a month now and he is boring, gets jealous very easily and a bit weird but good looking so that is why I have stayed with him. (bad sex though) Now I don't want to go out with him anymore but I do not want to hurt his feelings. What do I do?
