Genuinely feel so hated in my house, I’ve spoken to them about it in the past and they seemed to really try to make me feel included again but now I’ll be in the house and they’ll just be silent when I’m around them. It’s really bringing me down and I can’t wait for next year when I don’t have to deal with it anymore
