I suffer from major depression and my parter does not understand me. They keep saying I’m being unreasonable and that I am overreacting and making things more difficult than necessary. For this reason I do not feel like I can talk to them when I‘m struggling. They seem to dislike that I’m not more open with them but I don’t want to… More share much when I know that they always gets frustrated/annoyed/angry if I tell them what goes on inside my head. What do I do? I really need support and would love for my partner to be able to provide it since I don’t have many other people I can rely on but I think they would get angry and offended if I said this to their face.
