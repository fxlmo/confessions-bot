I’m a student with high functioning autism and for the most part I’m in support of the strikes (the cause at least), but yesterday I was meant to have an appointment with the DDSS who are meant to support people like me. I had waited a month for this appointment and really need it to organise what help I need for jan exams. BUT the… More person I was meant to see was striking, the next available appointment isn’t until after January exams and to top it all off the woman at the reception was extremely insensitive about it all (for someone who works in a disability support service). As someone who’s appointment literally related to my ability to cope with changes of plans and dealing with my emotions it was all a bit much and I had to run out the reception and calm myself down before I had a panic attack.
