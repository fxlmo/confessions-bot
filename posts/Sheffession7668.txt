I’ve never had a blackout night as bad as I did on UXD. (Forgetting to eat since breakfast probably didn’t help with the matter though.) From about 5pm onwards all I remember after that is waking up thinking it was still 8pm on UXD and that I’d had a nap. Little did I know I had been on the bar crawl and to roar and it was actually… More 8am the next day. Turns out I’d also had several long conversations with people that I have no recollection of, cried, lost my phone and no doubt embarrassed myself many more times. The scary part is that my friends didn’t even realise I’d gone to roar so I have no idea who I was with or what I did. Sorry to anyone that I might have pissed off or that saw me in that embarrassing state - I promise I’m not usually like that and it’s safe to say I’m never letting myself get like that again. What a way to end 2019.... P.S. shout out to the kind person who took me home and put a wok next to my bed as some sort of sick bucket, honestly don’t know how I would have made it home safe without you!
