As a third year student about to head into their final term I still can't get out of my head how Hugh Brady gave us a welcome speech in Fresher's week about how great uni is and that the majority of people find their husbands/wives at uni. Only got a few weeks left and not even a boyfriend to show for it. Wtf Hugh?!?!??
