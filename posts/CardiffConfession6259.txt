What do you do when you feel low but you don’t want to talk to anyone about it? I feel like this and people say that talking makes it better, but I don’t have anything to really say, I just feel lonely and unintelligent and like a failure and it stems from me not working as hard as I could be because I’m so demotivated… More because I feel low and shit, so it’s just... what do I do? How do I deal with this? It feels embarrassing too because it seems like an easy problem to fix, but it’s not. Idk how much of a confession this is as much as it is a cry for any kind of hell
