Recently moved into a new house, my boyfriend and I went out for a few drinks till late last night. Anyway, we stumble home and one thing leads to another... And I have THE squeakiest bed which we completely forgot about whilst being tipsy and in the moment. I'm really hoping everyone was fast asleep and didn't hear us, but judging by the amount of cold shoulders I'm getting today I think it's safe to say they probably did. and I am SO sorry
