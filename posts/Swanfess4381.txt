Look people, donâ€™t judge individuals who use the accessibility toilet. While some of us may not fit what you think as a disabled student, we do need that toilet, either for privacy or for space reasons. So making us feel like shit for using it only wether it be by comment or by stares, only reveals you to be a right sad and horrible cunt ðŸ˜¡.
