I've been thinking and figured out that I don't in fact hate writing essays, I don't mind reading articles on the subjects that I'm doing but I figured out what I'm bad at. Decoding the Brief/Task. And then I realised, why the fuck do I have to cipher out information out of a brief on what they want me to write about? Whenever Iâ€¦ More understand the question I can finish it quickly and even happily. But why am I left hopeless to figure out something that doesn't need to be hard? Why can't they just tell us the important shit and what they actually want to read?
