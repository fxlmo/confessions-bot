I am supportive of the strikes, but obstructing and passive aggressively asking third year students trying to get into the ASS if they realise thereâ€™s strikes on is just the wrong way to go. Stop targeting students that are trying to make the best of things and get on with their studies independently because all you are doing is alienating them.
