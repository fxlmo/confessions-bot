Was having a long, peaceful poo in chemistry west this afternoon when a bloke comes crashing through the doors and into a stall a few down from me. As soon as that door shut, and I mean AS SOON AS, this man had the most explosive and violent faecal decrement in the history of humankind. After a few minutes of horror for the both ofâ€¦ More us, he takes a large deep breath as to steady himself, but alas, this was to be his final fall from grace. The deep breath was far too great, filling his nostrils with the monstrosity that he had just created and the poor lad immediately chundered. I stayed on the loo for another 10 minutes, fully out of shock for what I had just heard.
