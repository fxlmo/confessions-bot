Anyone out there struggle going home for the holidays because your parents don't know the real you? You constantly feel like you are faking who you are or just feel uncomfortable. Wish they knew the real me like some of my friends do. maybe I should hold onto the friends that actually know me and care about me and just make it through the holidays. Uni is a blessing in disguise.
