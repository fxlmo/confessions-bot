My flatmate is an incel and I don't know what the fuck to do. Everytime I bring someone over he makes them super uncomfortable by asking them weird questions and just generally lingering around. He has ruined numerous dates for me and even barges into my room to try and catch us doing shit. He constantly complains to me afterwards that he can hear me having sex and to stop it (even if we didn't have sex??). I've told him to fuck off in every way imaginable but he persists.
