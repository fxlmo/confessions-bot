As a graduate now i cant stop thinking about those swansea days... you really dont know what you have until its gone. I know i came into first year knowing i wanted to make the most of unj and i thought i did but its NEVER enough. Think semester 1 of 1st year goes fast? Well that feeling is the entire 2nd year and 3rd year shit hitsâ€¦ More the fan, less going out,more work, time flies but in the way of deadlines coming up fast. Wish i could rewind to 3 years ago. GO to EVERY event you can and join some societies and just get OUT. Trust the real world is like downgrading to how life was in secondary school except you just go home and have no time or money to do anything
