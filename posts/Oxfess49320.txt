I know it's last week of term but I'm not filled with happiness like everyone else. I can't just take it easy. I found this term really rough, and now I'm entirely burned out; I can't even sit down and look at my sheets with anxiety hitting me. I keep thinking forward to the holiday and how much work I have to do for collections. I can't even feel myself enjoying the work because there's just so much pressure. So this hype about week 8 is really making me feel sick and shitty :(
