So one of my house mates always huffs and eye rolls when I’m in the kitchen washing up /moving pans/cooking because of the noise whilst they’re trying to do uni work....should they just get a fucking grip and work elsewhere (like react) or should I be more considerate of kitchen noises if they’re working (angry react)?
