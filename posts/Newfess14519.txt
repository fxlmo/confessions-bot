To the boys in the marj who just took the piss out of the period product machine (Tuesday evening) please stop having such shit crack and think about the poor girls who could’ve been walking to the machine and got so embarrassed because of your ignorance! Also “only in Newcastle” what do you mean by that? Only in Newcastle do we take a stand and allow young girls free access to period products? Surely that’s something to be proud of? Wankers
