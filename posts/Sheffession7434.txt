im not embarrassing on a night out, i save my embarrassing shit for when we get back and i’m just left dancing by myself in the garden to kid cudi (sorry to the neighbours thats a a proper sight) and then i realise i’ve left my bank card and bag at west street live and (for some reason) i go knocking on the next door neighbours shouting at them telling them not to steal because its a bad trait to have and it’s not gonna get them a job at claire’s after their pathetic degree finishes
