If you’re going home to a toxic environment this Christmas just know you’re not alone. Family is important yes, but it’s not everything, especially if they constantly put you down. I know it can be hard to block out the noise, especially at this time of year when everything is heightened and far more intense, but just know that friends will be waiting for you when you get back. Love from someone who knows what it’s like x
