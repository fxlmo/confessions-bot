I don’t think people realise how big of an issue homophobia is in the lives of Young LGBTQ+ people. Everyone says that it’s so much better now, but within the last few months I’ve been verbally harassed on the street 6 times, followed home twice and physically assaulted for kissing my girlfriend in a bar. I don’t complain about it… More because this is actually pretty normal now, but I guess it just sucks and I’ve started to go back into the closet with new people I meet because I’m terrified of losing friends or being attacked again. When will it get better?
