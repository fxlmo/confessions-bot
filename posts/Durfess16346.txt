Honestly the law school needs to get their act together. The number of times they have refused to help students because there are “too many people”, they “don’t want to be unfair to other students” and “you can always come to office hours” is absurd. Considering how few contact hours we already have, the least they could do is spend… More our £9k in a useful manner and actually implement the resources to ensure that they respond to students’ queries as and when they arise.
