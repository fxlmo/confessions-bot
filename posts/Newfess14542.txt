I did a foundation year and I’m now in my first year, both of which I have been in halls. I’m really wanting to move to a house in jesmond next year but all of my friends have plans with other friends. I’m now left stuck with no one to live with! Been looking on Castle Leazes for ideas but most look like strong friendship groups looking for one more person and I’m worried I’ll be left out. Any advice for a sociable gal who wants to live with fun people next year but just hasn’t met them yet☹️
