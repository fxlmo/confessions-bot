It seems very clear that all this NUS delegates election stuff is truly showing the SU for its true colours! Most of the candidates don’t represent actual Durham Students. Some aren’t even students anymore. If you’re not far-left then basically most of the candidates won’t represent you or your moderate to conservative views. Virtue Signalling is really what the election is about. #SEKHB
