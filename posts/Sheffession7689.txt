Massive shout-out to my amazing girlfriend who has been there for me during my struggles with mental health, I know she really struggled seeing me in pain but she stuck by me and helped me make progress. You're so strong and I honestly couldn't have done it without you ❤️ just want to say that although it may be hard to speak up… More about these things, it's important to not use just one person for support, so support them too by being brave and taking those next steps towards help, it's unlikely that they're a professional and they can support you but they can't give you the professional help that you need. And if you are struggling to support a loved one, keep supporting them and encouraging them towards professional help and look after yourself too by seeking some advice and support.
