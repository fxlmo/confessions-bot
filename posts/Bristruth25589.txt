I don’t know why some of you give other people so much shit just because of the particular course that they do. We’re all good at different things and we should all be allowed to excel in our own areas. You are all unique, but that doesn’t mean you’re better than anyone else. Stop putting each other down. There’s so much shit going on in this world so stop adding to it with all the unnecessary “My course is harder than yours” crap. It’s time to start supporting each other and celebrating our differences.
