i live with four other flatmates and we share one bathroom. On average, I have to take an urgent dump in my room's bin 3-4 times a week because they take forever in the shower. I then take the smelly plastic bag of shame out of the bin, and just put it in the kitchen bin. Till this day, they haven't noticed.
