I just wanted to say a universal thank you to all the student support and welfare officers here in Durham. You all go out of your way to make things okay, care and listen to people. If it wasn't for the welfare officers and student support in my college (Cuth's) I wouldn't have been able to get through this term, and I'm sure it's theâ€¦ More same for many many others in other colleges too. You are all so important and I hope you have a rest this Christmas and look after yourselves as much as you look after others. You are all incredible people.
