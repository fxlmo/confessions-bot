Please consider voting green if youâ€™re in Bristol West. In 2015 they got 4% of the vote, yet just 1 out of 650 seats. They deserve more of a say in parliament. And there is zero chance of the tories getting in here, so your insurance is it remaining a labour seat. This is one of the only places in the country where they stand a chance of getting a seat. You donâ€™t need to be an eco warrior to vote green ðŸ’š
