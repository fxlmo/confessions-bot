Okay. I need some advice help me out here. A guy tells me that he loves me. We’re not together but the only time he wants to talk to me is either when he’s drunk or horny. He knows I’m a virgin so when is horny he insists that he’ll wait until I’m ready. I’m really into this guy but he tries to guilt trip me into doing things e.g.… More come out to see him, spend the night with him (even if it is just to cuddle). Another big issue is his dad. He knows that if we were to get into a relationship his dad would hate it. Long story short is his dad is racist (his words not mine) but he still wants to be together. He’s trying to prove that he’s serious by asking me to come and meet his family. I don’t want to do. Why do I seem to attract either emotionally unavailable men or ones with commitment issues?
