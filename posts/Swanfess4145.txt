Can those people who hang out at the smoking areas on Bay Campus at 3 in the morning please be aware that ground floor flats can hear your entire conversation. I really don’t care that you got chlamydia or alternatively that you didn’t get laid, even though she was ‘gagging for it’. Please speak quieter or alternatively, fuck off somewhere else!
