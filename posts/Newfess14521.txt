So I've already posted before about my housemates being horrible to me and making me feel like I'm intruding in "their" /our student house... So now I'm getting my own back and playing domination with the living room TV since they always bar me from it cos there's more of them and I'm outnumbered... I'm just wondering what I should do cos I'm running out of ideas and I hate living with them, send help pleasr?
