A friend of mine recently came out to me as bisexual. How can I help them in the best possible way in terms of support? I know they’re struggling with the concept but I’m not sure how I can be of any help. They’re also struggling a lot with finding partners of the same sex, can I help them with this/help them get more involved in the LGBTQ+ community?
