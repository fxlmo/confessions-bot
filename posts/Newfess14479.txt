Recently I’ve been feeling the loneliest I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I’ve Re-downloaded tinder in the hopes of finding someone. All I want to do is hang out with someone and them to spend the night, I don’t even want to have sex at this point but just for someone to be there. For a while I slept around but now I feel so empty inside and as nice as the guys were I ruined it by jumping into sex first which can ruin the chances of them seeing me as anything more than just a quick shag and then they leave.
