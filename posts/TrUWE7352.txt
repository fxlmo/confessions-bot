Is anyone looking for a room in a 4 bedroom student share house? The rent including the bills is below £380 for a single bedroom in a nice quiet location very close to the Uni. I would not mind helping to pay half of first months rent if it helped to decide. I had a change of circumstances which is I want to move out. The house is very clean. I’ll keep looking out for this one so of you were interested, please comment below xx
