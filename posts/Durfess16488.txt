Anyone who has dealt with the DSU knows how incompetent they are. The website is a disaster, organising events through them is a nightmare, the sabbatical officers are clueless and have literally… More achieved nothing meaningful so far (apart from overruling Assembly and slowing down all processes). Any other organisation would fire its incompetent employees (in the dsu, almost everyone tbh) and apologise for being in such a mess, the DSU instead takes even more money from students and even from charity! The institutional DSU is making things worse for the students who volunteer for it, it’s time to get rid of it and give power back to the amazing volunteers!
