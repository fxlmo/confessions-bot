Does anyone actually pay the Bay Campus parking fines they receive from CP plus? On multiple occasions my parents have paid for the parking yet still have received a fine. I’m assuming that they’re a privately owned company and the threats to take you to court for the unpaid penalty is bs. Anyone know more about this ?
