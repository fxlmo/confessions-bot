SO there’s this guy I have a slight crush on. And I think he’s also into me cause he sometimes messages me and I’ve chatted to him in real life. But like I’m not 100% sure and his chat is like very dead on messages. Like how to I tell him I like him? Like do I just try and get off with him on a night out or do I like ask him out or smth?
