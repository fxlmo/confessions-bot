Might seem a bit stale this, but take it from an older student - stop spending time with people you don't enjoy or who don't make you laugh. Simple but effective. Can't tell you how much more I love life with people in it who make me happy rather than drag me down with petty wars and daily drama. Cut out the negative people, life is way too short.
