I saw someone walking in town today. She dropped something and to my realization it was half a bueno. I was gutted for her. She stood there and looked at it, probably contimplating whether or not to pick it up. However, she said her goodbyes and moved on and I just want to say well done. I don't know if I would have that much self-constraint.
