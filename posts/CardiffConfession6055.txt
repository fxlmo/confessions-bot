Has anyone got any genuine advice for first year student moving out of halls and into residences for the second year, I'm reading a lot of scary shit and honestly don't know what to do or where/when to start looking. I have about 4-5 friends that I want to move in with but is that even possible to move in as a group? Any advice is greatly appreciated!
