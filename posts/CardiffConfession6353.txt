This might sound really silly, but are there any girls in cardiff who would be willing to go to the gym with me (a very nervous, genuinely obese gal who is highkey scared of sticking out like a sore thumb) or who needs a weight loss/getting fit buddy for the new year? Iâ€™ve tried a million diets but the hurdle is always getting active, and I figured it might be easier if I have a pal to back me up ðŸ˜Œ (any tips on keeping motivated are welcome too)
