All I want for Christmas is a housemate who doesn’t leave all his sh*t right in front of the front f*cking door. Isn’t just love to walk into my house and not trip over four pairs of shoes, a gym bag, back pack, laundry basket and a c*nting full sized bike. Honestly I’m so f*cking tired of it you’re not living at home anymore grow up put your sh*t away.
