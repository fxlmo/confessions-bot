Every time I see a funny reading fess post I go to tag my “friends” in it and see they’ve all tagged each other but left me out... it’s happened the whole Christmas period- I’ve not spoken to any of them once despite tagging them in stuff/making an effort. It’s acc starting to upset me and I’m supposed to be living with them next year ...:(
