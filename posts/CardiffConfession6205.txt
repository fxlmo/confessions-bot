I need some serious advice. I think my friend has a serious drug problem. They smoke constantly and has said multiple times they can't cope without a joint - every time they're sober they has a complete personality shift to the point I no longer recognise my friend. It's ruining their metal health, their studies and all of their friendships. How do we go about confronting them about this and what resources can we point them to help?
