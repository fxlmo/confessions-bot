Christmas is shit. The grinch is a legend, he was trying to save the town from the evil commercialism which overtook them, and Scrooge hated the drinking and excess, only celebrating Christmas through sharing and giving to the poor.

Yes, I’m as surprised as you are how that turned out, was meant to be a joke...
