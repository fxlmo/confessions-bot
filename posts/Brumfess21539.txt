I’m the only person to clean the bathroom in my house this year, have cleaned the kitchen and living room multiple times and don’t even get a thank you from my housemates. I’m sick of being the only one to clean and even when I’ve asked them to do it no one has. We all really get along and I don’t want to fall out with anyone but I… More don’t understand why they can’t just clean up after themselves. They don’t even sort the recycling out ffs. There’s one guy in particular who i’ve literally never seen clean any of the communal areas or take the bins out and i’m fucking sick of it.
