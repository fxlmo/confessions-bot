Appreciation post for the well-being services at uni. Went through a pretty rough situation a couple of months ago and only just had the balls to go see someone. The person I saw was extremely helpful, made me feel so much better about what I went through and in general gave some amazing advice. For anyone considering opening up to someone I urge you to contact the well-being services at uni as even the first conversation you have with them can make a world of difference
