Unpopular opinion but people who respond “going” to events they haven’t yet bought tickets for are either arrogant or too optimistic. There is no way you can guarantee you’ll get a ticket, so how about wait until tickets are on sale and buy one, and ONLY then confirm you are going on the event. Otherwise you’re setting yourself up for ridicule come the day tickets sell out and you’re 5 minutes too late. Don’t be a goose.
