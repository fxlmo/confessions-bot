As we get into the holiday season it's a good idea to remember that not everyone has a great home life and Christmas can be a difficult time. I'm sorry if I come off a little 'scroogey' but for me there's a not lot to look forward to as I'm spending most the holiday avoiding my family rather than seeing them. To anyone in the same situation, I hope your uni family is much better, I know I'm really glad I have mine.
