To the bloke who I just approached from the behind like a predator in Eddy B (because I thought he was a mate)... but it turned out he was just a complete randomer and I'd just conversationally assaulted a stranger... who continued to exchange pleasantries with me whilst wearing a look of pure horror and despair on his face, thank you and sorry.
