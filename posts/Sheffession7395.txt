My friend and I were late to class, so naturally entered through the back entrance. Soon as we entered we realise that something is different but we sat anyways. After a solid 5 mins we come to the conclusion that it's the wrong class and the whole row behind, was laughing at us. We got up left, found out we were in the wrong building and finally decided that attending lectures is not our cup of tea
