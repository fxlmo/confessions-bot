A few people who I thought were my friends until recently just snaked me out and signed for a house which I found for us a booked a viewing for... now they wont talk to me and I have no one else to live with next year... I don't know what to do anymore, I was enjoying uni up until now but everything is falling apart and I don't know if I can handle it
