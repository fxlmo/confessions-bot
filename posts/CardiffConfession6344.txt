Is it weird I work at a cocktail bar and I DESPISE being called boss? I just think people who call people behind the counter boss or bossman are utter twats for thinking they're so cool and think we think they're cool when in reality we think nothing of them at all. Like I'm not your boss dude, I'm a person like you. We're equal. I just make the drinks.
