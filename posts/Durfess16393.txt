Lots of people around me are becoming very conscious about climate change and the need to limit our carbon footprints. I agree. But when it comes to frequency of flying, I find that too often, those who criticise others for the odd (and maybe recreational) European flight are also those who have already seen the world for reasons andâ€¦ More flown tens of times for reasons they may deem unavoidable. They may have family across the world, they might have had an international job or internship or volunteered in a developing country, or they may be a student abroad.
