People keep inviting me to/asking me if I'm going to various LGBT events and having spent most of my teenage years thinking I was bi or a lesbian I would once have been thriller but after an abusive relationship in which I was punished and belittled for my attraction to women, I'm pretty sure I'm basically straight and it's also justâ€¦ More not something I am going to be able to puzzle out right now and I'm not looking for a relationship in general anyway - so please don't sit there judging me for my internalised homophobia or whatever. I don't feel comfortable going to those events when I'm not sure I belong and I might just be a straight girl encroaching on LGBT spaces. I'm worried my anxiety relating to this issue may be coming off as homophobia so if any girls have received non-committal answers or been ignored about CAKE in particular please forgive me!!!
