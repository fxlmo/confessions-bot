my house mates don’t seem to care about anyone but themselves and each other, the energy has changed to something really weird and for the first time after a long time of so much progress i feel myself slipping back into depressive territory. this is the only time ive felt like its it my mind just purely the people around me and i really don’t know what to do about it??
