Find it so trippy now I’m in 3rd year that if I hadn’t chosen this specific uni, this course, the halls I was in, joined the societies I’m in, I wouldn’t have met some of the greatest people I know. I know this isn’t the same for everyone at uni and many people have bad experiences but big love to all the people who have made the past few years the best of my life ❤️
