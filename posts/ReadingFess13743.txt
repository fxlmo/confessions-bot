Hey so I'm the mystery 6'2 man with the long post on the 23rd. I wrote it as was feeling kinda depressed ngl but also thought it might make others who are feeling the same way this xmas feel better. But I've looked and I'm like wow there's about 100 likes and 70+ comments (the ghillie suit made me laugh) and I'm sat here thinking… More well I'm looking for someone, no one magically falls into anyone's lap and I've already practically advertised myself weirdly enough. I'm not back at uni until the new year around the 9th but if any girl is interested and would like to talk then give this a like, I'll pop up and we'll see what happens after I guess ❤
