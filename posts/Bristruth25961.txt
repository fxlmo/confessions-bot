My toxic trait is overthinking everything to the point that I no longer have a clear head when it comes to studying. I know that I need to prioritise my studying, but I can’t when I have so many things on my mind. Constant worrying. I’m so tired of always being anxious about things. I wish I never met some people, they’ve given me bad, horrible experiences. Anyone know what I can do about it?
