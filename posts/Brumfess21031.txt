Has anyone got any experience with dating/relationships with depression? I’ve avoided relationships for years because they always seem to worsen my mental health but I’m falling for someone now and I want it to work between us without my mental health becoming an issue. I always unintentionally start looking for someone to ‘save’ me and I don’t want that, so I guess what I’m asking is how to have feelings but not an unhealthy attachment? Idk anymore
