My girlfriend was trying to figure out what I got her for xmas, so as we're packing all the presents in the suitcase to go home she started tapping on hers and another one that she didn't realise was for her sister. They are both the same shape but she immediately decided they were bongo drums and the milk whisk I'd wrappedâ€¦ More separately was a pair of drum sticks. By not denying it immediately, I confirmed what it turns out is her deepest, darkest fear.
