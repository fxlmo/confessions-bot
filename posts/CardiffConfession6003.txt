I don't know who needs to hear this but.... FRIENDS IS SO OVERRATED! The jokes aren't funny (you only laugh because the backing track subconsciously makes you), it's homophobic, misogynistic, and at times very racist! And the irony is the people who find it funny still are the people who openly say how they are againstâ€¦ More homophobia, misogyny and racism. So if you truly are against all these then stop watching this toxic show and stop getting excited every time someone mentions a possible reunion episode because to be frank, it's going to suck if it tries to be politically correct and then you'll see how offensive this show actually was.
