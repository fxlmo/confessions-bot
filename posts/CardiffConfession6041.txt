Pro-choicers are so certain of their righteousness on the issue, yet ironically refuse to see that their sincere conviction in their beliefs is a trait shared by the religious. Perhaps try and understand that the religious have just as strong an idea of right and wrong as pro-choicers, rather than ridiculing an alreadyâ€¦ More marginalised minority on campus. You have no grounds to criticise 'religious authoritarianism' when you gleefully (and pathetically) witch hunt those you disagree with. Humility is a central aspect of wisdom, and the pro-choicers at this university display appalling levels of conceit and malice towards others. You are everything you pretend to hate. Get perspective.
