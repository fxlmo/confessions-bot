I feel as if (although uncomfortable for many) there needs to be a discussion about representation at Durham and I feel this and several other articles I've read sum it up well. PoC according toâ€¦ More this will soon make up 33% of the population (which will probably rise even further) but I feel that decolonisation efforts and inclusion haven't moved moved as fast as the demographic reality. Can we start to have a conversation surrounding this as a wider community ?
