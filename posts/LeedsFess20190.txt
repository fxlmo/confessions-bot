It’s the end of February. Global warming is at its peak. You decide to sack off the rest of your lectures that day and follow the streams of students heading towards the Mecca of Leeds; Hyde Park. You check the weather forecast on your phone. Sun. Sun. And more sun. 28 degrees, feels like 32. You open snap maps to see every single… More person you have all in the same bubble. You crack open your first can of your four pack of dark fruits, raise the sacred juice to your lips, and sigh. You look around, smiles everywhere. The smell of weed fills your nostrils. Different speakers all trying to play their sick beats the loudest. The football being booted at a local resident walking past and the accompanying whhhaaaaaaaaayyyyy. You look up at the sun and you think to yourself “Yes, Avicci. It really is time for a better day.”
