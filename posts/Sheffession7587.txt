If you're ever struggling with money and put off replacing things like clothes because they've developed tiny holes, BE WARNED, they will grow. I had a small patch on my skinny jeans that was wearing away that I chose to ignore because it was literally right under my crotch and I thought nobody would ever notice. I sincerely hope… More that nobody did notice because a few weeks later I was walking into uni and thought "my right testicle is feeling really cold" so I reached down and to my horror it had managed to sneak past my boxers and pop through the worn patch. I tried to pop it back through but it was a tight fit that was gonna hurt, figured I’d have to rip the jeans even more but then that would’ve risked even more exposure. And to top it all off I had to walk past a primary school to get to uni and it was for a 9am and I had definitely walked past at least 10 kids. I ended up taking a 30 minute detour around the school with my hand over my crotch for good measure. Think my friends might’ve been onto something when they called my movember a pedo stache.
