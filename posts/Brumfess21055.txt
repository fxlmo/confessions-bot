My housemates keep ignoring me and I genuinely don't know what I've done to them. They know I'd go miles for them and know that at times my mental health will dip, but they just keep acting as if I'm not worth their time. It's getting harder to try and not let it affect me mentally and harder to try and not confront them about it.
