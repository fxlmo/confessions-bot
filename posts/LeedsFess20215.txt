I'm in a long distance relationship and I love my girlfriend to bits, but can't help like I am missing out on uni life. I see her once a month and feel like I have one half of me at home and one at uni because of it. I could legitimately marry this girl and she is my best friend, but I have thoughts of being single, not to shag myâ€¦ More way through Leeds but just to have my mind fully in my uni experience and ambitions. She also doesn't go to uni which makes relating to certain aspects of my life hard. Our relationship isn't the problem, but I just don't know if I want to do long distance anymore (got 2-3 years left), advice please?
