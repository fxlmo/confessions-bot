To all you labour voters complaining - you’re all a bunch of self-righteous hypocrites, none of you give money to homeless people on the streets for as much as you say you care. If Labour won, the money for the homeless would be coming out of your tax anyway so what’s the difference??? Honestly lose your moral-superiority it doesn’t suit you and you’re no better than the rest of us.
