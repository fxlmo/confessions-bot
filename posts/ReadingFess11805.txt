I feel like I deserve better in my relationship but I’m too scared to break up with my partner. I always put in 110% effort and would do anything for them but I get the bare minimum back. But I still love them and I’m scared to be on my own. I’ve tried talking to them about it but it goes straight through their head. The brave… More part of me wants to dump them right now and be strong and independent but the part that knows I’ll cry myself to sleep for so long is stopping me. I don’t know what to do but I can’t stop thinking about it and it’s making me angrier and angrier everyday. They might even read this but I doubt they’d register I’ve written it because they pay so little attention...
