Is it weird that I haven't met my boyfriend's best friend after 7 months? She's always messaging him, and he always makes plans with her when I go away. I've spoken to him about it and even tried to invite her to things. I'm starting to think theres more to this relationship, but I just can't dont know what to think anymore. Am I being paranoid or? I just know that I'd be really excited to meet my besties partner.
