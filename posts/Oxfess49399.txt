i’m a closeted lesbian and idk what to do anymore, I have a boyfriend that loves me and I love him too but I’m not sexually attracted to him. i’m afraid of coming out because it would turn my life upside down and i’m quite comfortable with the life i’m leading now, i just sometimes wish i could be my true self
