Is it weird that my guy mates kiss me on the side/top of my head/face sometimes when they hug me? It only ever happens when I go out drinking with different friends separate from my boyfriend, and it’s happened with a few different guys from different friend groups that I’m not necessarily that close with. Does it mean something other than just a friendly hug? Or am I just overthinking things?
