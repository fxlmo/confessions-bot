My girlfriend of over a year got several hickys recently after a night out with her best friend and told me about them the day after. She said it was from her best friend who's a female, if that even matters. I broke down in tears and left the room. She didn't understand the problem with it and doesn't consider that cheatingâ€¦ More however I think that being intermate with anyone except for your SO is cheating so didn't think I has to mention that wasn't alright. I then said what if a male best friend tried to do the same and her reply was she wouldn't let it happen and wouldn't let them get close. Am I over reacting or is this straight up cheating?
