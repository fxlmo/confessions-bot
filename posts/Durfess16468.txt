To the two girls who helped me out on Saturday night, when I was too drunk and fell asleep on the sidewalk of North Road - thank you so much. You brought me all the way back to my college in a taxi, called my boyfriend for me, and helped me out with the police officer who was super displeased. You’re very good people, and I’m forever thankful.
