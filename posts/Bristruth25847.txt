Tories are twats and they don’t deserve to win but I hate how many horrible, low swooping, downright nasty comments I have seen from Labour supporters. Do not let Politics divide us. People have conflicting hard decisions to make and yes many have been deluded but do u not make them all out to be villains. Yes a lot of us will… More probably be worse off but when you wish pain and death on people you are just creating further divides in this country. Accept the loss with grace. Stop attacking others and start treating them with kindness. Do not stoop to the politicians level you are better than that. AND GET INVOLVED in all grassroots and local politics to minimise the effect of the Tories. This is not the end. We are the future of this country and only we can affect the change we want to be. And that is not done through pure hatred.
