So I went into Tesco today to sort out travel money for the Xmas holidays with my gf, and all was going fine, I take my money out of my wallet and attempt to give the cashier the money to be changed. That’s when the girl on the desk said that for anything over 100, she needs to see ID from whoever is making the exchange (note: it’s MY… More money, coming from MY wallet, which I took out IN FRONT of her?? (she says any form of passport or drivers licence or photo ID)).
