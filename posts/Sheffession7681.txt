2019 is coming to an end and if I could share one thing with everyone, it is: Please. For the love of god. DO NOT hold grudges against people. Life is way too short for hate and anger. I've seen best friends stop talking and exes hate each other issues that could have simply been resolved over a single conversation. Yes, I knowâ€¦ More people hurt you and make you feel like shit, but most of the time they don't realize that they are. 99%, no one intentionally wants to hurt you. We are humans and as humans we are flawed creatures. We make mistakes. We regret them. We learn. We grow. But the one thing we can all do to make life easier is to communicate, forgive and move on. So if you've lost touch with a friend or a ex or ANYONE for that matter- just have a conversation. Remember how much this person meant to you. Realize that life is way too precious to waste it on hate. Love you all.
