I keep getting my friend cabs so she doesn’t walk home alone at night. But it’s kinda expensive. She refuses to get her own and instead walk, even with all these stabbings in the area. I understand that she can’t really afford it too. I can’t walk with her without getting into the same situation at the other end. What should I do? I’m trying to do a good thing and keep her safe but it’s not sustainable.
