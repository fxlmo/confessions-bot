She meets an incredible guy who's kindhearted, generous, open, loyal, sweet, builds her up when she's in a bad place, goes ahead to open doors for her, makes sure she's okay, treats her like a queen, and is a complete gentleman. He tries to teach her his language, and to love herself. His eyes twinkle when they meet and she findsâ€¦ More herself smiling, forgetting that she wanted to cry. He hugs her and reminds her how strong he thinks she is, making sure she knows that he appreciates her. She makes him laugh when they're together, a sense of joy when he stops walking needing to gain composure. With him she can be herself. Upon a shooting star many would dream he could he hers, and she could be hers, while her only wish is that their friendship shall main forever no matter how far apart, because few are granted the honour and blessing of a bond send from the heavens.
