I don’t want to say I’m depressed because I know it’s an illness and like all illnesses you should get the diagnosis from a medical professional, but I’ve been really down lately. I’ve been doing things I regret, some things that others see and some things that are unseen. I wish I could tell someone, but I’m just a coward.
