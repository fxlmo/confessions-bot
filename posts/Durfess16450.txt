Can we all just take a moment to collectively disapprove of sleazy male lecturers who make so many women at Durham feel uncomfortable. It’s completely unacceptable and I honestly wish other male lecturers would speak up on behalf of creeped out female students. It all just gets brushed aside like it’s nothing.
