Last week I let myself go past the deadline for my essay (50% of my module) due to the death of a friend. But still I was not able to do it this week and can’t even bring myself to write a little. I know I’m going to fail if I don’t do it but it has just been a hard time. Is there anything I can do because I don’t want to fail the year????
