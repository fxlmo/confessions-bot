To the house on Lower Redland Road: for once I am very very thankful the walls between us are so thin. If they weren't I never would have heard your House of Commons style debate where the motion was put to the Honourable Speaker of the House to get "all coked up" and vigorously debated with all its pros and cons until 1:45am. I particularly enjoyed the Opposition's rebuttal that a beer break was needed before anything else could happen.
