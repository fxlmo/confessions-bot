God hath forsaken the students of Hyde Park in Leeds, the small market town on the banks of the River Aire in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Their incessant use of drugs, relentless desire to participate in sinful pre-marital sex and lack of respect for the authorities has made them hell-worthy in the eyes of our saviour. May the Lord have mercy on their souls.
