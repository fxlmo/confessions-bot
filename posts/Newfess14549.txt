Since uni started I’ve slowly felt my mental health get worse and worse, I get back to my flat everyday and just feel depressed and very lonely. I’m still a virgin and I’m not motivated enough to do anything about it because I have no self confidence. I feel like two completely different people throughout the day, when with friends I… More feel great and motivated but when alone I am the complete opposite. I am someone who has had miniature mental health issues in the past (that my friends are aware of) but nothing serious. Please make sure to check up on your friends every now and again (even if you don’t talk often/aren’t the closest) because we need it.
