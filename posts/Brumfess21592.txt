To all my wonderful friends that I haven’t been particularly sociable with recently, it’s not that I don’t want to spend time with you or that I’m too busy for you. I’m working through some mental health issues and don’t feel ready to share them yet, but please do still invite me to hang out. I’d love to see you if I’m able to. I love you all
