Shout out to the guy in Billy B cafe who made his sandwiches at the table (assembled with a tub of butter, halloumi and impressive selection of spice grinders) before whipping a full-sized toastie maker out of his backpack and, 5 minutes later, presenting said toasties on a tinfoil mat to his perplexed friend. You said you hoped to get a durfess out of it, so here you go. From the equally perplexed, yet fascinated girl sitting opposite.
