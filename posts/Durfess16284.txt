I’ve got this problem where I only get out of bed for a meal deal. Then I buy said meal deal and go to the library, but I don’t like eating in the library so I leave the library. I go home to eat my meal deal, I fall asleep. I wake up and only then leave again to get a meal deal, then repeat. Also I don’t get past the first stage if can’t find a nice sandwhich. Help
