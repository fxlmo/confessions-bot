To whoever needs to hear this... STOP trying to influence peoples voting in the general election! If you vote conservative vote for them! Labour? Do the same! But if you’re not clued up and are just voting for what people tell you to have a look at smaller parties e.g Plaid Cymru, Green party or lib dem and you might find what you like there! Follow what YOU believe and dont be bullied into voting for what’s popular!
