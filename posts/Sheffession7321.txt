As an Erasmus student, I want to applaud the amount of open, friendly, interesting clubs you have here in Sheffield. I've never had so much after uni fun than I have had here. Don't take it for granted Sheffield students try something new once in a while: swing dance, choir, ceilidh, peak district walks. This place is amazing and I'm going to miss it so much.
