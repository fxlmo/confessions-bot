Itâ€™s a bit late but just wanted to tell you all that people from ultimate frisbee are the nicest people ever!!! Last sports night, I lost all my friends and was in a bit of a state, when a girl from ultimate came up to me and asked if I needed help. She reunited me with my friends then danced off again into the night. Thank you my ultimate frisbee angel! x
