So if people haven’t heard, there’s plans to shit down several of the uni’s libraries to turn them into study spaces. The books from places like the science library would be moved to Bute library. Being a science student this doesn’t exactly seem ideal and it’s not really gonna get us a whole lot more study space. I reckon… More the uni are trying to cost cut for the new building by the SU. Anyway, if you guys wanna sign this petition maybe we can do something about it.
