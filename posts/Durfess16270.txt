Do people that do rowing know that they don't have to. Like it's not a prerequisite for going to Durham. Everyone I know who rows is always busy with rowing and yet I've never once heard them be at all excited about that prospect. Just pick a different sport guys, maybe one that can be done at times other than 6:30AM.
