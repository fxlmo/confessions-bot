This is a submission from a second year student who has gone home for the Christmas holidays. I have found I have drifted apart from some of my close school friends back at home. Is that normal? I've been struggling to make arrangements to meet up with people this holiday and always use my uni work as an excuse. I have noâ€¦ More plans for New Years Eve and I feel very lonely. Being at university I seem to be in a different world. My uni friends are from all over the country and some even abroad. I'm not sure if I am lonely or what. Anyone else feel like this?
