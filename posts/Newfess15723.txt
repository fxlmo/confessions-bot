I am just wondering whether I’m missing out on the true uni experience by being in a relationship for the whole time. I mean I am not sure there is any sort of long term future with my partner even though they are a great person and I’m enjoying my time, but all my friends spend their time dating, meeting people and sleeping around a bit and I just wanna ask if it’s as good as it seems?
