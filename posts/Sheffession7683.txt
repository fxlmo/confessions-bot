Just wanted to say a massive thank you to the people who helped with getting a homeless man into the back on an ambulance on Friday night. Sorry if I got quite aggressive at any point, I was just really quite worried. Also a big shout out to Oasis Pizza for letting us bring him into the warmth and reheating the rest of a pizza half an hour after closing time for his partner.
