Just a PSA to NEVER use GLIDE, just had an email for our bill and WE DONT EVEN USE THEM AS A BILL PROVIDER, had so much hassle when we first moved in September with them trying to get us to pay the previous tenants debt. They try and exploit young students who they think are naive and don't understand their rights. shite customer service aswell.
