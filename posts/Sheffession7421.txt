All the talk about girls having low confidence.. a while ago Justin Bieber did a song called Beauty and a Beat. At the time it was in the charts I was in a club and it was playing. When he sung the word beauty a girl pointed at me and I've never felt better. I was still too shy to go talk to her just in case she rejected me.
