First year girl looking to start a band. Preferably something with a classic rock/psychedelic element to it. Influences like Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, amongst many others. I can sing decently and play rhythm guitar. If you’re interested, comment what instruments you play and I’ll message.
