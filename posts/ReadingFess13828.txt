I’m not going to be ungrateful, but my boyfriend really doesn’t put in enough effort with me around special occasions, for example his Christmas presents were so bad. They were just so random and nothing that I asked for, I don’t want to be showered in expensive gifts but a bigger effort would be nice and he left all the prices on and I got a card that didn’t even say girlfriend on. Am I being ungrateful or does my man need to step up?
