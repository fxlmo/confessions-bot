Imagine this, you’re in 2012. You’re in school with your friends, you’ve got double Science first thing in the morning, and you’re waiting for the bell to go so you can buy some snacks. You’re not thinking about the future, you’re just thinking about what you’re going going to buy at break, and you can’t wait to get out of class. You buy… More a chocolate or crisp at the vending machine, the bell goes off and you’ve got French next. This is the class where you all mess around and don’t pay attention. Life is good, you’ve got no worries. Fast-forward to 2019.... now you’re in uni feeling depressed af, got so many deadlines, is this what adult life is? Is what you constantly question.
