There are two people loudly talking next to me in the library. I tried coughing a few times, I have tried typing aggressively, I even put my hand down a bit too firmly on the desk to indicate my frustration with them. None of it worked. Please send help, I'm all out of ideas and if something isn't done soon I might be forced to let out an excasperated sigh and shift in my seat slightly...
