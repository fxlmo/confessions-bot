To whoever needs to hear it, the situation you’re in isn’t permanent, the things you’re struggling with may be overwhelming but you can get through it and there is always light at the end of the tunnel. It might not seem like it, but there are so many people who care about you and want the best for you. Don’t exclude yourself and try to deal with it alone.
