I am fed up of the attitude that the chemistry department have towards its students. We work hard throughout the year to meet weekly lab report deadlines and writing lit perspectives with veryâ€¦ More limited advice on how to do so, as well as trying to keep up with all the content heavy lectures and reviewing these lectures before the workshops.
