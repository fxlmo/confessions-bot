I'm in my second year and my grades so far have been so much lower than in year 1. Feeling really disheartened as I'm working really hard but I feel like I'm doing so badly now. Do lecturers just inflate grades in the 1st year? I thought I was doing so well but now I'm so much more nervous about every assessment; especially now the grades are counting towards what we graduate with. Is this normal or is it just me?
