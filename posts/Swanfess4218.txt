So my dumbass has been waking around campus with an empty baggie, from this tuesday, at the back of my see through phone case. Went to my lectures, on the bus, in the library, all the shops.... and the person who told me was a junkie in uplands right before I went to work "girl ya might wanna put that away" cheers, at least I wont get fired today
