It’s UXD, I’m pissed out of my face and naturally super friendly. I stop to talk to some Jesus people who were handing out leaflets. Unfortunately, I stop for a bit too long and miss the entry to roar. Massive thanks to the security who believed me and unlocked the doors, when I said “Please let me in, some Jesus cult just tried to… More recruit me”.
