I know lots of people either shit on the gender neutral toilets or like them cos they can fuck, but personally as a non binary person they make me feel so so so validated in such an unbelievably cisgendered world. They make me so happy to be at this university - so thank you so much to whoever made these happen you will never know how happy you make the non binary students of this uni xxxx
