Was sat in silent study today and this guy walks in and sits down dead-ass in front of me. I decided he was a normal person and things were peaceful for a few seconds until he started sniffling like his life depended on it (it probably did). Next thing I know, I'm sat there trying to salvage my degree while this guy coughs up threeâ€¦ More gallons worth of phlegm. Pls listen up. If you are sniffling, do not come to silent study. It is silent. S. I. L. E. N. T. That means no sniffling, no nose blowing and no coughing up blood on my desk. Please take your work to A&E and let me revise in peace.
